    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: The Hind Samachar Limited vs. Punjab Kesari Publishers Pvt. Ltd. and Ors.**\n\n**Background:**\nThe Hind Samachar Limited (Plaintiff) and Punjab Kesari Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (Defendant) are parties involved in a dispute over the use of the trade mark \"PUNJAB KESARI\" and \"DAILY PUNJAB KESARI\". The dispute arises amongst family members, with both parties claiming exclusive rights to use the trade mark in different territories.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe plaintiff sought rectification of the registration of the trade mark maintained by the Registrar of Trademarks, aiming to cancel the registration granted to the defendant (Respondent 1) for the trade mark no. 3353424 dated 2nd September 2016. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's use of the trade mark in certain territories was unauthorized and sought to restrict the defendant's use to specific areas.\n\n**Arguments:**\nDuring the pendency of the petition, an oral Family Settlement was arrived at between the family members, which was later reduced to writing in a Memorandum dated 16th July 2022. The Memorandum demarcated the territories in which the plaintiff (VKC group) and the defendant (AKC group) could use the subject mark. The plaintiff sought to dispose of the case in terms of the Memorandum, directing rectification of the Register of Trade Marks to restrict the defendant's use of the trade mark to specific territories.\n\n**Court Findings:**\nThe High Court of Delhi, presided over by Hon'ble Mr. Justice C. Hari Shankar, considered the Family Settlement and the Memorandum dated 16th July 2022. The court noted that the settlement demarcated the territories for the use of the trade mark by both parties, providing a clear division of areas where each party could use the mark.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court disposed of the case in terms of the Memorandum dated 16th July 2022. The court directed rectification of the Register of Trade Marks in respect of Trademark No. 3353424 dated 2nd September 2016, restricting the defendant's use of the trade mark to the territories of:\n\n* Delhi\n* Uttarakhand\n* Madhya Pradesh\n* Chattisgarh\n* Assam\n* Gujarat\n* Haryana (only in Bhiwani, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Mahindragarh, and Rewari districts)\n* Uttar Pradesh (specific districts mentioned in the Memorandum)\n\nThe plaintiff (VKC group) retained the exclusive right to use the trade mark in the remaining territories, including Punjab, Haryana (except the specified districts), Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Chandigarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Kerala, and Nepal, as well as specific districts in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe court's decision effectively resolved the dispute between the parties, providing a clear demarcation of territories for the use of the trade mark and allowing both parties to coexist while minimizing potential conflicts.",
