The defendants had access to their copyrighted works and trademark, and had used them without permission.\n2. The defendants' actions had caused irreparable harm to the plaintiffs' business and reputation.\n3.

Accordingly, the present suit has been filed seeking a decree of \npermanent injunction along with other ancillary reliefs. \nCASE SET UP IN THE WRITTEN STATEMENT \n6. \nThe case set out in the written statement is as under: \n6.1. The defendant no.1 is in the business of manufacturing various \nrailway track components such as concrete sleepers, rail fastening \ncomponents for normal tracks, elevated and underground tracks for \nmetro railways and ballastless tracks suitable for high-speed lines, \nbridges, tunnels and the like. \n6.2. The engineering drawings for the ‘Double Resilient Base Plate \nSystem’ submitted by the defendant no.1 are as per the technical \nspecifications, dimensions and features given by the MPMRCL for \n„Design, Supply, Installation, testing and Commissioning of \nBallastless Track of Standard Gauge, including Supply of Fastening \nSystem…for Bhopal Metro Rail Project‟ and in conformity with the \nguidelines issued by the Ministry of Railways, as amended from time \nto time. Therefore, the same can be supplied by any entity including \nthe defendant no.1. \n6.3. The Railway Board, Ministry of Railways has approved a total of six \nfastening systems for ballastless tracks, any of which can be used by \nmetro railways/mass rapid transit systems [hereinafter ‘MRTS’] in \nIndia. All six fastening systems are designed by different \ncompanies/entities and exclusive rights can be claimed by such \ncompanies/entities only if registrations are obtained thereof.

The DBRAS purported to have been developed and designed by the \nplaintiff no.1 is not registered under the Patents Act, 1970 or the \nCopyright Act, 1957 or the Designs Act, 2000. \n6.5. The drawings of the plaintiff no.1 are in the public domain, being \neasily available on the internet, as also on the official website of the \nMinistry of Railways. \n6.6. No copyright subsists in the drawings of the plaintiff as per Section 15 \nof the Copyright Act, 1957 read in conjunction with the Designs Act, \n2000. \n6.7. The defendant no.1 has not commercially exploited the trademark \n‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiff no.1. The trademark reflected on the \ndrawings submitted by the defendant no.1 to various contractors was \nonly an inadvertent error on part of the defendants no.2 to 4, who \nmistakenly left the said mark on the drawings while converting them \nfrom PDF files to AutoCAD files. The said inadvertent error was \nrectified as soon as it was brought to the attention of the defendants \nand the drawings were re-submitted to the contractors without the \n‘PANDROL’ mark. \n6.8. Even otherwise, no manufacturing or production of the Double \nResilient Base Plate Assembly System components has been \nundertaken by the defendant no.1. Therefore, no case for infringement \nof the trademark of the plaintiff no.1 or passing off is made out.  \n7. \nThe plaintiffs have also filed a replication, wherein, in addition to the \npleadings put forth in support of the case set up in the plaint, it has been \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 7 of 27 \n \nsubmitted that the intention of the plaintiffs was not just to safeguard its \neconomic interest by filing the present suit but also to prevent the MPMRCL \nfrom being deceived by the defendants using the copyrighted drawings and \ntrademark of the plaintiffs. \nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS \n8. \nIn support of the case set up in the plaint, the senior counsel appearing \non behalf of the plaintiffs made the following submissions: \n8.1. The defendants have infringed the copyright and trademark \n‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiff by copying the drawings of the plaintiffs \nin toto. The said fact has been admitted by the defendants in \nparagraph 21 of the written statement and also affirmed in the report \ndated 22nd September, 2022 filed by the Local Commissioner. \n8.2. Clause 4.2 of the tender floated by the MPMRCL specifically \nprovides that a tenderer offering the supply of fastening systems is \nrequired to provide, inter alia, the approval letter obtained from the \nRDSO/Ministry of Railways along with the approved drawings of the \nfastening system, certificate of performance and the like. Therefore, \nthe subject matter of the tender was in respect of a generic product \nand not specifically the plaintiffs’ product. Hence, there was no \njustification for the defendants to unauthorizedly copy the drawings of \nthe plaintiffs. \n8.3. Even if it is assumed that the tender of the MPMRCL required \ncopying of the approved drawings of the plaintiffs, there was no basis \nfor the defendants to expressly provide that the drawings submitted by \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 8 of 27 \n \nthem have been drawn, checked, reviewed and approved by their \nemployees, the defendants no.2 to 5. \n8.4. The drawings of the plaintiffs are not covered under the ambit of \n‘design’ as defined in Section 2(d) of the Designs Act, 2000 for the \nfollowing reasons: \ni. \nThe drawings of the plaintiffs constitute ‘artistic work’ as \ndefined under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957.  \nii. \nThe drawings of the plaintiffs are a mode/principle of \nconstruction of a fastening system, which is expressly excluded \nfrom the definition of the word ‘design’ as provided under \nSection 2(d) of the Designs Act. \niii. \nThere is no visual appeal to the drawings of the plaintiffs which \nwould qualify the drawings of the plaintiff to fall in the \ncategory of ‘design’. \n8.5. Since the drawings of the plaintiffs do not constitute a „design, which \nis capable of being registered under the Designs Act, 2000‟  the \nreliance placed on Section 15(2) of the Designs Act, 2000 by the \ndefendants, is misplaced. \nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS \n9. \nIn support of the averments made in the written statement, senior  \ncounsel appearing on behalf of the defendants made the following \nsubmissions: \n9.1. The drawings of the plaintiffs are in the public domain since 2010, \nwhen they were first published in the United Kingdom. The drawings \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 9 of 27 \n \nhave also been published on the RDSO website as attachments to the \napproval letter dated 7th October, 2011. \n9.2. The tenderer was required to match completely with the drawings and \nspecifications of the test assembly. Reliance in this regard is placed on \nClauses 2 and 4 of the approval letter dated 7th October, 2011 issued \nby the Ministry of Railways. \n9.3. The Ministry of Railways has approved six fastening systems, which \ncan be supplied by any vendor on the basis of the approved drawings. \n9.4. Plaintiffs do not have any copyright over their drawings within the \nmeaning of Section 14 of the Copyright Act, 1957. In fact, the \ndrawings of the plaintiffs constitute „design capable of being \nregistered‟ under the Designs Act, 2000. \n9.5. The plaintiffs have already supplied more than 21,00,000 fastening \nsets and 50,00,000 elastic rail clips in various projects. Reliance in \nthis regard is placed on paragraphs 14, 25 and 26 of the plaint. \nTherefore, no copyright subsists in the drawings of the plaintiffs as \nper Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. \nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS \n10. \nI have heard the rival submissions. \n11. \nAt the outset, I will address the submissions made on behalf of the \ndefendants that the plaintiffs could not claim any copyright in the aforesaid \ndrawings in light of Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act, 1957. To consider \nthe aforesaid submissions, a reference may be made to the relevant \nprovisions of the Copyright Act as well as the Designs Act. \n12. \nRelevant provisions of the Copyright Act are as under: \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 10 of 27 \n \n“2.

In support of this submission, \nsenior counsel for the defendants has placed reliance on various judgments, \nwhich are discussed below. \n15. \nIn Microfibres Inc v. Girdhar And Co. and Anr., 2009 SCC OnLine \nDel 1647 a Division Bench of this Court was seized of similar issues with \nregard to the interplay of various sections of the Copyright and Designs Act \nin order to determine whether a work is capable of being registered under \nthe Designs Act, by virtue of which no copyright in respect thereof could be \nclaimed as per Section 15(2) of the Copyright Act. After comparing the \nrelevant provisions of the Designs Act and Copyright Act, the Division \nBench observed as under: \n“22. \nTherefore, it is the exclusive right of the holder of a \nCopyright in an original artistic work to reproduce the work in \nany material form. For example, a drawing of an imaginary \nfuturistic automobile, which is an original artistic work, may be \nreproduced in the three-dimensional material form using an \nelement, such as a metal sheet. When the copyright holder of an \noriginal artistic work reproduces the same in another material \nform, he may, or may not do so by employing an industrial \nprocess or means which may be manual, mechanical or \nchemical, separate or combined, on an article. If the \nreproduction of the original artistic work is done by employing \nan industrial process, as aforesaid, on an article, and the same \nresults in a finished article which appeals to the eye as \nadjudged solely by the eye, then the features of shape, \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 13 of 27 \n \nconfiguration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or \ncolours applied to the article by the industrial process \nconstitutes a “design”, within the meaning of this expression as \ndefined under the Designs Act. \n23. \nThere is, therefore, a clear distinction between an \noriginal artistic work, and the design derived from it for \nindustrial application on an article. This position is clarified by \nthe use of the expression “only” before the words “the features \nof shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of \nlines or colours” in the definition of “design” in the Designs \nAct. Therefore, the original artistic work, which may have \ninspired the creation of a design, is not merely the feature of \nshape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines \nor colours which are created to apply to an article by an \nindustrial process. The original artistic work is something \ndifferent from the design. Secondly, the definition of “design” \nexpressly excludes, inter alia, any artistic work defined in \nsection 2(c) of the Copyright act, 1957. \nXXX  \n \n \nXXX  \n \n \nXXX \n30. \nSub-section (2) of section 15 deals with the situation \nwhere the design, which is capable of being registered under the \nDesigns Act, is not so registered. It provides that copyright in \nsuch a design shall cease as soon as any article to which the \ndesign has been applied has been reproduced more than 50 times \nby an industrial process by the owner of the copyright or with his \nlicence, by any other person. It is clear to us that the Parliament \nin Section 15 of the Copyright Act was dealing with the aspect of \ncopyright in a registered/registrable design, as understood in the \nCopyright Act and not the Designs Act. Else, there was no need \nto deal with this aspect in the Copyright Act. The same would \nhave been dealt with under the Designs Act. Therefore, the law \ntolerates only a limited industrial, or shall we say commercial, \nexploitation \nof \nthe \noriginal \nartistic \nwork \nby \nthe \napplication/reproduction of the said work in any other form or \nreproduction of copies thereof in exercise of the rights under \nSection 14(c)(1) and 14(c)(iii) of the Copyright Act.

This \nis also evident from the definition of the design under Section \n2(d) of the Designs Act. This, in our view, in fact is a factor \nwhich would go against the appellants in construing the nature \nof protection to be given to the original artistic work such as a \npainting, as contrasted with the applied artistic work that is the \ndesign, which in the present case does not mean the \nintermediary \nmedium \nsuch \nas \na \nmould, \nengraving \ndevised/produced only to enable industrial application of the \npainting to produce the furnishing products of the appellant. \nThus, while the original painting would indeed be entitled to \nthe \ncopyright \nprotection, \nthe \ncommercial/industrial \nmanifestation of such paintings such as the design derived from \nand founded upon the original painting for the purpose of \nindustrial production of furnishings would only be covered by \nthe limitations placed in Section 15 of the Copyright Act and \nwould get protection if registered as a design under the Designs \nAct but would enjoy lesser period of protection in case of a \nregistered design. \n36. \nThis clearly shows that the legislature intended that \neven if the artistic work such as a painting has been used as the \nbasis for designing an industrially produced object for \ncommerce, such as the furnishing in the present case, \nnevertheless the original painting would indeed enjoy full \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 15 of 27 \n \ncopyright protection, while the result of the industrial \napplication of such painting, namely, the design used in the \nindustrial production of the ultimate product shall enjoy lesser \nperiod of protection as stipulated under the Designs Act \nprovided it is registered as a design under the Designs \nAct. Thus, we are of the view that an original artistic work \ninitially acquires protection under the Copyright Act as an \n„artistic work‟ or else the protection under the Designs Act qua \nthe product created from the artistic work when industrially \napplied.” \n16. \nThe law was summarised by the Division Bench in paragraph 46 of \nthe judgment, which is set out below: \n“46. \nWe thus summarize our findings as follows:— \na. The definition of „artistic work‟ has a very wide \nconnotation as it is not circumscribed by any limitation of \nthe work possessing any artistic quality. Even an abstract \nwork, such as a few lines or curves arbitrarily drawn \nwould qualify as an artistic work. It may be two \ndimensional or three dimensional. The artistic work may \nor may not have visual appeal. \nb. The rights to which a holder of an original artistic work \nis entitled are enumerated in Section 14(c) of the Copyright \nact. \nc. It is the exclusive right of the holder of a Copyright in an \noriginal artistic work to reproduce the work in any material \nform. For example, a drawing of an imaginary futuristic \nautomobile, which is an original artistic work, may be \nreproduced in the three-dimensional material form using an \nelement, such as a metal sheet. \nd. The design protection in case of registered works under \nthe Designs Act cannot be extended to include the copyright \nprotection to the works which were industrially produced. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 16 of 27 \n \ne. A perusal of the Copyright Act and the Designs Act and \nindeed the Preamble and the Statement of Objects and \nReasons of the Designs Act makes it clear that the \nlegislative intent was to grant a higher protection to pure \noriginal artistic works such as paintings, sculptures etc \nand lesser protection to design activity which is \ncommercial in nature. The legislative intent is, thus, clear \nthat the protection accorded to a work which is \ncommercial in nature is lesser than and not to be equated \nwith the protection granted to a work of pure art. \nf. The original paintings/artistic works which may be used \nto industrially produce the designed article would continue \nto fall within the meaning of the artistic work defined \nunder Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and would \nbe entitled to the full period of copyright protection as \nevident from the definition of the design under Section \n2(d) of the Designs Act. However, the intention of \nproducing the artistic work is not relevant. \ng. This is precisely why the legislature not only limited the \nprotection by mandating that the copyright shall cease \nunder the Copyright Act in a registered design but in \naddition, also deprived copyright protection to designs \ncapable of being registered under the Designs Act, but not \nso registered, as soon as the concerned design had been \napplied more than 50 times by industrial process by the \nowner of the copyright or his licensee. \nh. In the original work of art, copyright would exist and \nthe author/holder would continue enjoying the longer \nprotection granted under the Copyright Act in respect of \nthe original artistic work per se. \ni. If the design is registered under the Designs Act, the \nDesign would lose its copyright protection under the \nCopyright Act. If it is a design registrable under the Designs \nAct but has not so been registered, the Design would \ncontinue to enjoy copyright protection under the Act so long \nas the threshold limit of its application on an article by an \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 17 of 27 \n \nindustrial process for more than 50 times is reached. But \nonce that limit is crossed, it would lose its copyright \nprotection under the Copyright Act. This interpretation \nwould harmonize the Copyright and the Designs Act in \naccordance with the legislative intent.” \n17. \nWhat emerges from a reading of the judgment of the Division Bench \nis that an original ‘artistic work’ is different from a ‘design’. The original \ndrawings/ ‘artistic work’ can lead to a ‘design’. In other words, a ‘design’ \nmay be derived from the original drawings. Therefore, even if the original \ndrawings/ ‘artistic work’ is used to industrially produce an article, the \noriginal drawing/ ‘artistic work’ would continue to fall within the meaning \nof the artistic work defined under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 \nand would be entitled to the full period of copyright protection. \n18. \nIn Mody Pumps Inc and Anr. v. Sovereign Pumping Solutions \nProvate Limited and Anr., MANU/MH/1496/2022 a Single Bench of the \nBombay High Court was dealing with a similar issue of copyright \ninfringement in relation to engineering drawings of water pumps and the \nissues that arose were whether the aforesaid engineering drawings constitute \n‘artistic work’ and whether the plaintiffs have copyright in the same. \nRelying upon the judgment of the Division Bench in Microfibres (supra), \nthe Bombay High Court held that drawings are ‘artistic works’ within the \nmeaning of Section 13(1)(a) of the Copyrights Act and are therefore, \nexcluded from the purview of Section 2(d) of the Designs Act. It was \nobserved by the Bombay High Court that in terms of Section 2(d) of the \nDesigns Act, 2000, design relates only to shape, configuration, pattern, \nornament or composition of lines or colours applied to an article, which, in \nthe finished article, would have a visual appeal.

Section 2(d) also \nexcludes any ‘artistic work’ as defined in Section 2(c) of the Copyrights Act.  \n19. \nIn the present case, the plaintiffs claim copyright in respect of their \noriginal drawings. In terms of the judgment in Microfibres (supra), even if \nthe original drawings may be used to industrially produce an article, they \nwould continue to fall within the meaning of ‘artistic work’ under Section \n2(c) of the Copyright Act and also continue to enjoy full copyright \nprotection.  \n20. \nIt is also to be noted that a ‘design’ in respect of a finished product is \nyet to emerge in the present case. Therefore, no ‘design’ capable of \nregistration under the Designs Act has come out on the basis of the \nplaintiffs’ drawings. Additionally, the drawings of the plaintiffs relate to \nfastening systems, which are mere mechanical devices that have functional \nutility. By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the aforesaid \ndrawings reflect a product, which, in its finished state, would have any \nvisual appeal. Consequently, the aforesaid drawings are not be capable of \nbeing registered as a ‘design’ under the Designs Act. \n21. \nCounsel for the defendants has placed reliance on the judgments in \nHolland Company LP and Anr. v. S. P. Indusries, 2017 SCC OnLine Del \n9370 and Jagdamba Impex v. Tristar Products Pvt. Ltd., 2014 SCC Online \nDel 2872. However, the said judgments do not take into consideration the \nearlier decision of the Division Bench in Microfibres (supra), which I have \nrelied on to reach the conclusion above. Therefore, need is not felt to delve \ninto the aforesaid judgments. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 19 of 27 \n \n22. \nNow, I shall address the issue of whether any copyright for the \naforesaid drawings vests with the plaintiffs or if it has been assigned in \nfavour of the Ministry of Railways. \n23. \nThe Ministry of Railways laid down the performance criteria for \n„fastening system for ballastlass track on metro railways‟ vide its \ncommunication dated 21st May, 2010. The said communication also \nprovided that metro/MRTS were free to choose their fastening system for \nballastlass track complying with the performance criteria. In terms of the \naforesaid performance criteria laid down by the Ministry, the plaintiffs \nobtained approval from the Ministry of Railways. \n24. \nAt this stage, a reference may be made to the approval given by the \nMinistry of Railways to the plaintiffs on 7th October, 2011. The subject \nmatter of the said approval reads as follows: \n“Double Resilient Base Plate Assembly Fastening system-\ncorrigendum reg.” \n25. \nThe other relevant terms of the said approval are set out below: \n“…..Accordingly, to operationalize the approval given to the \ndouble resilient baseplate assembly system, the following is \nadvised:-  \n \n1. A copy of the Performance Certificate of the Dubai Metro \ndated 28.10.2010, based on which RDSO has considered the \nperformance of the system, is attached herewith as \nAnnexure-1. The Metro Railways/MRTS System should \nverify the authenticity of the system proposed to be used by \nthem vis-à-vis this Performance Certificate. \n \n2.

The metro railway/MRTS system are at liberty \nto carry out any tests for this as considered necessary. \n \n3. Before this system is installed in the track, Metro \nRailways/MRTS System should satisfy themselves about \ntheir chosen fastening system meeting the physical \nparameters requirements of the Performance Criteria, by \nconducting fresh tests from an independent laboratory on \nsamples selected by Metro Railway/MRTS system. \n \n4. The clearance is only for the “double resilient base \nplate assembly fastening system” of M/S Pandrol Limited, \nUK., Metro Railways/MRTS Systems should verify \nthemselves about the credentials of the prospective \nsuppliers of this system.” \n \n26. \nIn view of the approval granted to the plaintiffs, the products of the \nplaintiffs became eligible for being tendered for various metro projects. \nThere is nothing in the aforesaid approval letter to suggest that the copyright \nin respect of the plaintiffs’ drawings was to vest with the Ministry of \nRailways or that the plaintiffs have waived their copyright in respect of the \naforesaid drawings. Defendants have failed to place any documents or \nmaterial in support of their contention that the copyright in respect of the \ndrawings of the plaintiffs has been waived by the plaintiffs. Even if it is \nassumed that the copyright has been transferred to the Ministry of Railways, \nit does not give any right in favour of the defendants to copy the said \ndrawings. Hence, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants that \nonce the drawings of the plaintiffs got approval from the Ministry of \nRailways and were annexed to the approval letter, they become a part of the \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 21 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 21 of 27 \n \ncatalogue of the Ministry and any third party can make a bid based on the \naforesaid drawings. \n27. \nReliance placed on behalf of defendants on Clauses 2 and 4 of the \napproval letter dated 7th October, 2011 to submit that the tenderers have to \ncompletely match the drawings and specifications of the test assembly \nexamined by RDSO, is completely misplaced. The aforesaid clauses are \nonly in relation to approval granted to the plaintiffs. The reference to \n„prospective suppliers‟ in Clause 4 would only mean authorised suppliers of \nthe said products. This would not, in any manner, give a license to other \nsuppliers to use the copyrighted works of the plaintiffs. \n28. \nSenior counsel on behalf of the defendants has submitted that in terms \nof the tender document floated by the MPMRCL, for a party to bid for the \naforesaid tender, it had to bid in terms of the drawings of the plaintiffs.  \n29. \nAt this stage, reference may be made to the relevant part of the tender. \nThe scope of the tender is set out below: \n“„Design, Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of \nBallastless Track of Standard Gauge, including Supply of \nFastening System for Purple Line from AIIMS to Karond and \nRed Line from Bhadhbhada Square to Ratnagiri Tiraha, \nincluding Elevated and Underground sections along with \nBallasted/Ballastless Track in Depot cum Workshop at Subhash \nNagar‟ for Bhopal Metro Rail Project.” \n30. \nThe other relevant extracts of the tender are as under: \n“4.2.1 Requirements for Fastening System for Ballastless Track \n… \niii.

The defendants \nwere obligated to bid for the tender on the basis of the drawings of the \nplaintiffs. \n32. \nSenior counsel on behalf of the plaintiffs correctly points out that the \naforesaid tender of the MPMRCL was not in respect of products to be \nmanufactured specifically in terms of plaintiffs’ drawings. The tender \nfloated by the MPMRCL was in respect of „design, supply, installation, \ntesting and commissioning of ballastless track of standard gauge, including \nsupply of fastening system‟. The same is reiterated in clause 4.2.1(iii) \nextracted above. The drawings developed and designed by the plaintiffs, as \ncan be seen from the approval letter, were for the DBRAS. Therefore, it \ncannot be said that the tender was confined to products based on the \nplaintiffs’ drawings. The tender was for a generic product and the drawings \nof the plaintiffs were only one of the approved drawings. Therefore, there is \nno merit in the submission of the defendants that the tender floated was in \nrespect of a specific product to be manufactured as per the drawings of the \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 24 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 24 of 27 \n \nplaintiffs and consequently, the defendants did not have any option but to \ncopy the drawings of the plaintiffs in order to manufacture the said product.  \n33. \nIn fact, any party who had obtained approvals from the Ministry of \nRailways could have supplied the products under the aforesaid tender. It is \nthe defendants’ own case that approvals have been received by six \ncompanies/entities for the aforesaid products and each one of them was free \nto bid for the tender. If the defendants failed to prepare their own drawings \nand get the same approved from the Ministry of Railways, the defendants \ncannot be permitted to copy the drawings of the plaintiffs. \n34. \nA perusal of paragraphs (ix) of clause 4.2.1 of the tender document \nextracted above would show that the tenderer could be a person other than \nthe six companies/entities with the RDSO/Ministry of Railways approvals. \nTherefore, it was open for the defendants to approach one of the \ncompanies/entities whose drawings had been approved or their supplier(s) \nand obtain a licence/enter into an agreement in respect thereof, to bid for the \ntender. \n35. \nClearly, the plaintiffs would have spent considerable time, effort and \nfinancial resources and undertaken extensive research and development to \ncreate the aforesaid drawings. If the contention of the defendants is \naccepted, then it would be open for any person to copy the work of another \nand commercially exploit the efforts of the original creator. This would \namount to permitting the defendants to unjustly enrich themselves at the \nexpense of the plaintiffs.  \n36. \nI am not persuaded by the submission of the defendants that if \nsuppliers that do not have RDSO/Ministry of Railways approvals are barred \nfrom using the drawings of the plaintiffs, a monopoly would be created in \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 25 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 25 of 27 \n \nfavour of the plaintiffs. There cannot be any question of a monopoly by the \nplaintiffs as besides the plaintiffs, five other companies/entities have \nreceived approvals from the RDSO/Ministry of Railways.  \n37. \nIt has vehemently been contended on behalf of the defendants that \nplaintiffs have not impleaded the Ministry Railways in the present suit and \nthat their presence is necessary to determine the question of whether any \ncopyright vests with the plaintiffs or if it has been assigned in favour of the \nMinistry of Railways. In my view, the aforesaid submission is completely \nunsustainable. It is the case of the defendants that plaintiffs have \nassigned/waived the copyright in favour of the Ministry of Railways or that \nthe copyright vests with the Ministry of Railways. Therefore, the onus is on \nthe defendants to prove that the copyright has been assigned/waived by the \nplaintiff in favour of the Ministry of Railways or that the same vests with the \nMinistry of Railways in any case. The stand of the Ministry of Railways, in \nthe present case, would be wholly irrelevant.  \n38. \nFurthermore, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants that \nno copyright subsists in the drawings of the plaintiffs since no registration \nhas been obtained in respect thereof. Registration is not a prerequisite to \nseeking protection from infringement under the Copyright Act.  \n39. \nSenior counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants has not disputed \nthe fact that the drawings of the plaintiffs have been copied in toto by the \ndefendants. However, he justifies the same by submitting that since the \naforesaid drawings of the plaintiffs were approved by the Ministry of \nRailways and tenderers were required to bid in terms of the said approval, \nthe defendants did not have any choice but to copy the drawings of the \nplaintiffs. Interestingly, on one hand, the defendants admit that they have \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 26 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 26 of 27 \n \ncopied the drawings of the plaintiffs,  yet in the drawings of the defendants it \nhas been noted that the said drawings have been drawn, checked, reviewed \nand approved by different personnel of the defendant no.1. Clearly, the \nattempt of the defendants in doing so was to show the drawing as their own \noriginal work. \n40. \nIf the defendants actually believed that there was no copyright in the \ndrawings of the plaintiffs and they could freely copy the same, there was no \nneed to put the name of their own personnel as the creators of the aforesaid \ndrawings. The extent of copying by the defendants is not confined just to the \ndrawings of the plaintiffs but goes on to include the unique numbering given \nto the said drawings by the plaintiffs. Reference in this regard may be made \nto pages 13 to 38 of the documents of the plaintiff.  Further, while copying \nthe aforesaid drawings, the defendants have also copied the mark \n‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiffs in some of the drawings, though the \ndefendants submit that it was on account of an inadvertent error. \n41. \nA reference to the Report of the Local Commissioners appointed by \nthe Court reveals that when the Local Commissioners visited the premises of \nthe defendants, the systems/laptops of the personnel of the defendants \ncontained the original drawings of the plaintiffs bearing the trademark of the \nplaintiffs, ‘PANDROL’. The Report also states that when the Local \nCommissioners searched for the term ‘PANDROL’ on the two laptops of the \ndefendants, various documents showed up, which included various drawings \nof the plaintiffs and other ‘PANDROL’ related data. When asked about the \nexistence of such data on their systems, no explanation was forthcoming \nfrom the defendants as to how did they obtain such data of the plaintiffs. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 27 ---\n2023/DHC/001792 \n \nCS(COMM) 602/2022                                                                                                       Page 27 of 27 \n \n42. \nThe discussion above leaves no doubt in my mind that the defendants \nhave dishonestly copied the drawings in respect of which the copyright vests \nsolely with the plaintiffs. Further, this has been done in a brazen manner so \nas to derive a competitive advantage. In my considered view, this can \nneither be permitted nor condoned. \n43. \nAccordingly, the present application filed on behalf of the plaintiffs \nunder Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC is allowed and the order \ndated 2nd September, 2022 is confirmed till the final adjudication of the suit. \n44. \nTaking into account the conduct of the defendants in having \ncompletely copied the drawings of the plaintiffs and seeking to justify the \nsame, the defendants are burdened with costs of Rs.1,00,000/- to be paid to \nthe plaintiffs. \n45. \nNeedless to state, any observations made herein are only for the \npurposes of adjudication of the present application and would have no \nbearing on the final outcome of the suit. \nCS(COMM) 602/2022 \n46. \nList before the Joint Registrar on 26th April, 2023 for further \nproceedings. \n \n \nAMIT BANSAL, J \nMARCH 13, 2023 \nsr/rt \n \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified\n"

The Designs Act defines \"design\" as the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament, or composition of lines or colors applied to an article by an industrial process. The court notes that the definition of \"design\" excludes any artistic work defined in section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957. The Copyright Act deals with copyright in a registered/registrable design, and Section 15 provides that copyright in such a design shall cease if reproduced more than 50 times by an industrial process.

This position is clarified by \nthe use of the expression “only” before the words “the features \nof shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of \nlines or colours” in the definition of “design” in the Designs \nAct. Therefore, the original artistic work, which may have \ninspired the creation of a design, is not merely the feature of \nshape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines \nor colours which are created to apply to an article by an \nindustrial process. The original artistic work is something \ndifferent from the design.

The approval letter requires Metro Railways/MRTS Systems to verify the credentials of prospective suppliers and conduct fresh tests from an independent laboratory. The court notes that there is no suggestion that the copyright of the plaintiffs' drawings was transferred to the Ministry of Railways. The defendants failed to provide evidence that the plaintiffs waived their copyright, and even if the copyright was transferred, it would not give the defendants the right to copy the drawings.

The defendants' senior counsel submits that bidders had to bid according to the plaintiffs' drawings. The tender's scope includes the design, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of a ballastless track for the Bhopal Metro Rail Project. The court examines Clauses 2 and 4 of the approval letter dated October 7, 2011, which the defendants claim require tenderers to match the plaintiffs' drawings and specifications. However, the court argues that these clauses only apply to the plaintiffs' approval and do not grant other suppliers a license to use the plaintiffs' copyrighted works. (Source: 16.

However, the plaintiffs' senior counsel countered that the tender was for a generic product, not specifically based on their drawings. The court agrees with the plaintiffs, stating that the tender was for \"design, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of ballastless track of standard gauge, including supply of fastening system\".

The plaintiffs spent significant time, effort, and resources creating the drawings, and allowing the defendants to copy them would be unjust enrichment.

Clearly, the \nattempt of the defendants in doing so was to show the drawing as their own \noriginal work. \n40. \nIf the defendants actually believed that there was no copyright in the \ndrawings of the plaintiffs and they could freely copy the same, there was no \nneed to put the name of their own personnel as the creators of the aforesaid \ndrawings. The extent of copying by the defendants is not confined just to the \ndrawings of the plaintiffs but goes on to include the unique numbering given \nto the said drawings by the plaintiffs. Reference in this regard may be made \nto pages 13 to 38 of the documents of the plaintiff.  Further, while copying \nthe aforesaid drawings, the defendants have also copied the mark \n‘PANDROL’ of the plaintiffs in some of the drawings, though the \ndefendants submit that it was on account of an inadvertent error. \n41. \nA reference to the Report of the Local Commissioners appointed by \nthe Court reveals that when the Local Commissioners visited the premises of \nthe defendants, the systems/laptops of the personnel of the defendants \ncontained the original drawings of the plaintiffs bearing the trademark of the \nplaintiffs, ‘PANDROL’. The Report also states that when the Local \nCommissioners searched for the term ‘PANDROL’ on the two laptops of the \ndefendants, various documents showed up, which included various drawings \nof the plaintiffs and other ‘PANDROL’ related data. When asked about the \nexistence of such data on their systems, no explanation was forthcoming \nfrom the defendants as to how did they obtain such data of the plaintiffs. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified",

          "summary": "According to page 27 of the PDF \"16. Pandrol vs Patil Rail.pdf\", the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, PANDROL LIMITED & ANR. The court found that the defendants had dishonestly copied the plaintiffs' drawings to gain a competitive advantage. The application filed by the plaintiffs under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC was allowed, and the order dated September 2, 2022, was confirmed until the final adjudication of the suit. The defendants were ordered to pay Rs.1,00,000/- in costs to the plaintiffs. The court noted that any observations made were only for the purposes of the present application and would not affect the final outcome of the suit. The next hearing was scheduled for April 26, 2023, before the Joint Registrar. The judgment was delivered by AMIT BANSAL, J on March 13, 2023.",

Further, this has been done in a brazen manner so \nas to derive a competitive advantage. In my considered view, this can \nneither be permitted nor condoned. \n43. \nAccordingly, the present application filed on behalf of the plaintiffs \nunder Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC is allowed and the order \ndated 2nd September, 2022 is confirmed till the final adjudication of the suit. \n44. \nTaking into account the conduct of the defendants in having \ncompletely copied the drawings of the plaintiffs and seeking to justify the \nsame, the defendants are burdened with costs of Rs.1,00,000/- to be paid to \nthe plaintiffs. \n45. \nNeedless to state, any observations made herein are only for the \npurposes of adjudication of the present application and would have no \nbearing on the final outcome of the suit. \nCS(COMM) 602/2022 \n46. \nList before the Joint Registrar on 26th April, 2023 for further \nproceedings. \n \n \nAMIT BANSAL, J \nMARCH 13, 2023 \nsr/rt \n \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:13.03.2023 16:57:01\nSignature Not Verified",
