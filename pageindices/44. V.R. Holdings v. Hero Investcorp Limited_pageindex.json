    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: V.R. Holdings v. Hero InvestCorp Limited and Anr.**\n\n**Background:**\nThe case involves a dispute over the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" registered by Hero InvestCorp Limited under Class 10 for medical and surgical instruments. V.R. Holdings, a partnership firm, seeks to remove this registration from the Register of Trade Marks, claiming to be the trademark holding entity of the Munjal Group of companies.\n\n**Factual Background:**\nThe Munjal Group, which began using the trademark \"HERO\" in 1956 for bicycles and bicycle parts, expanded its business and eventually divided its businesses among four family groups (F-1, F-2, F-3, and F-4) through a Family Settlement Agreement (FSA) and a Trade Mark and Name Agreement (TMNA) executed on May 20, 2010. The petitioner, V.R. Holdings, claims to be part of the Munjal Group and asserts that the trademark \"HERO\" was assigned to it for use in respect of certain goods and services.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe main issues in this case are:\n\n1. Whether the registration of the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" by Hero InvestCorp Limited under Class 10 is valid and can be retained.\n2. Whether V.R. Holdings has the right to use the trademark \"HERO\" in respect of medical and surgical instruments.\n\n**Arguments:**\nThe petitioner, V.R. Holdings, argued that:\n\n1. The trademark \"HERO GROUP\" was assigned to it through the TMNA and FSA, and therefore, Hero InvestCorp Limited's registration is invalid.\n2. The petitioner has been using the trademark \"HERO\" in respect of medical and surgical instruments and has acquired goodwill and reputation in the market.\n\nThe respondents, Hero InvestCorp Limited and Anr., argued that:\n\n1. The TMNA and FSA do not assign the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" to V.R. Holdings for use in respect of medical and surgical instruments.\n2. The registration of the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" under Class 10 is valid, and V.R. Holdings has no right to use the trademark in respect of these goods.\n\n**Court Findings:**\nThe High Court of Delhi, after analyzing the FSA and TMNA, found that:\n\n1. The TMNA and FSA do not explicitly assign the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" to V.R. Holdings for use in respect of medical and surgical instruments.\n2. The registration of the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" under Class 10 by Hero InvestCorp Limited is valid, as it was made in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court dismissed the petition filed by V.R. Holdings, holding that:\n\n1. The petitioner, V.R. Holdings, has not made out a case for removal of the registration of the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" under Class 10.\n2. The respondent, Hero InvestCorp Limited, is entitled to retain the registration of the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" under Class 10.\n\nThe court's decision is based on the analysis of the FSA and TMNA, which do not support the petitioner's claim to the trademark \"HERO GROUP\" in respect of medical and surgical instruments. The court also considered the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and the principles of trademark law to arrive at its decision.",

None other than a proprietor can, therefore, seek \nregistration of a trademark. Mr. Sibal‘s contention is that the F-3 \nGroup, represented by Respondent 1, was not entitled, under the FSA \nand TMNA, to regard itself as the lawful proprietor of the HERO \nGROUP trademark in respect of medical equipment.  The F-3 group \ncould not, therefore, seek registration of the mark HERO GROUP in \nits favour for medical equipment.

According to the said Clause,  \n(i) \nthe F-1 Family Group (represented by the \npetitioner) would have exclusive right of ownership and \nuse over the F-1 Family Group Trade Marks, and  \n(ii) \nthe F-3 Family Group would have exclusive right \nof ownership and use over  \n(a) \nOther Products and Services Trade Marks \nand \n(b) \nFuture Products and Services Trade Marks. \n \n(ii) \nClause 2(v) further stipulated that, notwithstanding \nanything to the contrary contained in the TMNA, the F-3 \nFamily Group would have exclusive right of ownership and use \nof the HERO GROUP trade mark in relation to all Other \nProducts and Services and Future Products and Services. \n \n(iii) ―Other Products and Services Trademarks‖ was defined \nin Clause 1.1.9 of the TMNA as the trademark HERO with or \nwithout suffixes, in relation to or in connection with, ―Other \nProducts and Services‖. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

This was sought to \nbe explained thus: \n \n(i) \nClause 1.1.8 defined ―Other Products and \nServices‖ to mean all types of goods and services \ncurrently manufactured or produced and excepted, \nfrom its ambit, F-1 Family Group Products and \nServices.

Where, read with \nClause 1.1.6(e), Clause 1.1.8 expressly excluded, from \nthe ambit of ―Other Products and Services‖, medical \nproducts, it would run contrary to the intent of the \ncontract to include medical products within the \nentitlement of the F-3 Group by regarding them as \n―Future Products and Services‖ in Clause 1.1.10.  In \nother words, the contention is that where the right of the \nF-3 Group to use ―HERO‖, with or without suffixes, for \nmedical products, stood expressly excluded by Clause \n1.1.8, that right could not be conferred by Clause 1.1.10.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 15 of 57    \n \n \nIt would amount, in other words, to giving by one hand \nwhat the other hand was taking away. \n \n(b) \nIncluding \nmedical \nproducts \nwithin \n―Future \nProducts and Services‖ in Clause 1.1.10 would also result \nin conflict between Clause 1.1.10 and Clause 1.1.7(c).  \nClause 1.1.7(c) granted exclusive right of use and \nownership, to the F-1 Group, of the HERO ECO mark for \nmedical goods.   If medical goods were to be treated as \n―Future Products and Services‖ under Clause 1.1.10, that \nwould mean that the F-3 Group could use HERO or other \nsuffixes for medical goods.  In other words, the F-3 \nGroup would then have the right to use even HERO ECO \nfor medical goods.  That would infract the exclusive right \nto use HERO ECO for medical goods, granted to the F-1 \nGroup by Clause 1.1.7(c). \n \n(xii) Resultantly, medical products did not fall within the \nambit either of the expression ―Other Products and Services‖ or \nof the expression ―Future Products and Services‖.  Neither \nClause 2(iii), nor Clause 2(v) of the TMNA could, therefore, \nentitle the F-3 group to use the HERO GROUP mark for \nmedical products. \n \n(xiii) Mr. Sibal further submits that without prejudice to his \ncontention that, in view of Clause 1.1.8 read with Clause \n1.1.6(e), there was a contractual presumption that medical \ngoods were ―currently manufactured‖ on the date of the \nFSA/TMNA, against which the F-3 Group, being bound by the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

That, however, was never done.  \n \n8.3 \nMr. Sibal submits that, comparing the interpretations accorded \nto the Clauses of the FSA and TMNA by the petitioner F-1 Group and \nthe respondent F-3 Group, it became clear that the petitioner‘s \ninterpretation was more in accordance with the contractual intent.  It \nwas clear that the FSA and TMNA intended to compartmentalise \nownership and usage, by the various groups, of the various Trade \nMarks as well as the goods and services in respect of which they \ncould be owned or used.  Overlap of Trade Marks in respect of the \nsame goods within one territory was, therefore, contrary to the \ncontractual intent.  Any interpretation which would result in one \nFamily Group becoming entitled to use the HERO formative \nTrademarks for the same goods within the same territory was, \ntherefore, required to be eschewed.  The FSA and TMNA, therefore, \nconferred exclusivity on  \n(i) \nthe F-4 Group in respect of bicycle/automotive \nTrademarks; \n(ii) \nthe F-1 Group in respect of the F-1 Family Group Trade \nMarks HERO EXPORTS, HERO ELECTRIC, HERO ECO and \nHERO, in respect of specific goods and services and \n(iii) the F-3 Family Group in respect of Other Products and \nServices Trade Marks, and Future Products and Services \nTrademarks, being the trademarks relating to the residual goods \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

He submits that the F-1 \nFamily Group had received ₹ 850 crores from the F-3 Family Group \nfor limiting its rights under the FSA and TMNA, which fact the \npetition conceals.

Under the said clause, the F-1 \nFamily Group was entitled only to use four specific marks, in respect \nof specified goods.  The four marks which the F-1 Family Group \ncould use were HERO EXPORTS, HERO ELECTRIC, HERO ECO \nand HERO.   In each case, the right of ownership and usage applied to \nthe marks as such.  In other words, the rights of F-1 Family Group did \nnot expand to the use of the said marks with any prefixes or suffixes. \nThis, he submits, is in stark contradistinction to the right of usage \nconferred on the F-3 Family Group by other clauses of the TMNA, \nwhich extended to the use of the mark ―HERO‖ with or without \nsuffixes or prefixes.  \n \n9.5 \nInsofar as medical products and equipments are concerned, the \nright of the F-1 Family Group was restricted to Clause 1.1.7(c), which \nwas limited to the HERO ECO mark. The petitioner did not, therefore, \nenjoy any right of ownership or usage for the HERO GROUP mark, as \nthe HERO GROUP mark was not one of the four marks which \ndevolved on the petitioner under Clause 1.1.7 of the TMNA.   \n \n9.6 \nThe petitioner could not, therefore, claimed to be ―aggrieved‖ \nby the impugned registration of the HERO GROUP mark in favour of \nthe F-3 Group in respect of medical products.

Insofar as \nmedical products were concerned, the ambit of ―F-1 Family Group \nTrade Marks‖ in Clause 1.1.7 extended only to the use of the HERO \nECO mark.   In this context, Mr. Nayar also placed reliance on Clause \n1.2(a) of the TMNA, which provided that headings and bold \ntypefaces, as used in the TMNA, were to be ignored while interpreting \nits provisions.   \n \n9.9 \nEven otherwise, Mr. Nayar submits that the petitioner V.R. \nHoldings is not a party either to the FSA or the TMNA.

Holdings. The petitioner V.R. \nHoldings, even as per the recitals in the petition, he points out, is \nstated to be engaged in the business of automotive components. As \nsuch, it is not even manufacturing or dealing in medical products.  \n \n9.11 Mr. Nayar contests the claim of the petitioner that it was the \n―Trade Mark holding entity‖ for the purposes of the FSA and TMNA.  \nHe points out that, against column (ix) in the rectification petition \nfiled by the petitioner, the entry which required the Trade Mark \nholding entity to be defined, the form was left blank.   \n \n9.12 Mr. Nayar further submits that the present petition suffers from \nserious delay and laches. He points out that Respondent 1 applied for \nregistration of the HERO GROUP mark in its favour on 1st November \n2010, and the mark was registered in favour of Respondent 1 on 30th \nAugust 2016. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in \nKhoday Distilleries Ltd. v. Scotch Whisky Association12, Mr. Nayar \nsubmits that a rectification petition which is so belated cannot be \nentertained on merits.  \n \n9.13 Mr. Nayar further relies on certain collateral documents which, \naccording to him, evince recognition, by the petitioner, of the right of \nRespondent 1 to use of the mark HERO GROUP in respect of medical \nequipment.  He refers to e-mail dated 4th June 2013 from Ashok Goyal \nof HERO ECO to Amit Aggarwal of Respondent 1, in which it was \nspecifically stated that all references to ―HERO GROUP‖ had been \n                                                 \n12 (2008) 10 SCC 723 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 22 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

He further referred to \npower of attorney dated 13th June 2013 by Vijay Kumar Munjal, \nwhich recognises the right of the F-3 Group, under the FSA and \nTMNA, to obtain registration of any HERO mark, with prefix or \nsuffix, except the four marks specifically allocated to the F-1 Group \nunder Clause 1.1.7, i.e., HERO EXPORTS, HERO ELECTRIC, \nHERO ECO and HERO. \n \n9.14 Insofar as the rights of the F-3 Group to use of the mark HERO \nGROUP in respect of medical equipment was concerned, Mr. Nayar \nsubmits that the rights of the F-3 Group flow both from Clauses 1.1.8 \nand 1.1.9 (which dealt with other products and services) and Clauses \n1.1.10 and 1.1.11 (which dealt with future products and services), read \nwith Clause 2 (v) of the TMNA.  \n \n9.15 He explains this position thus: \n \n(i) \nClause 2 (v) granted exclusive right and ownership, to the \nF-3 Group, to use the mark HERO GROUP in respect of Other \nProducts and Services and Future Products and Services. \n \n(ii) \nThe expression ―future products and services‖ was \ndefined in Clause 1.1.10.

In that view of the matter, Mr. Nayar submits that the \nF-1 Group was entitled, by virtue of Clause 1.1.10 read with Clause \n2(v), to use the HERO GROUP mark for medical products.  \n \n9.17 Mr. Nayar also claims that his right to use the HERO GROUP \nmark for medical products and services cannot be said to fall within \nthe exclusionary part of Clause 1.1.8 of the TMNA.

As such, the exclusionary part of \nClause 1.1.8, in Mr. Nayar‘s submission, has to be restricted to use of \nthe mark HERO ECO in respect of medical goods and products.  It \ncannot be extended to cover areas where no right has been conferred \nfor use of the mark on any other family group. \n \n9.19 As such, Mr. Nayar submits that the petitioner‘s right cannot be \ncurtailed by reference to the exclusionary part of Clause 1.1.8 of the \nTMNA.   \n \n9.20 Mr. Nayar further submits that the rectification of the register or \nremoval of a mark therefrom under Section 57 of the Trade Mark \ncannot be sought on the basis of a private contract. It is only where the \nregistration of the mark is prohibited by some provision in the Trade \nMarks Act that rectification of the register and removal of the mark \ncan be sought.  He points out that Section 57(2) permits rectification, \nby removal of a mark from the register, either where the entry is made \nwithout sufficient cause, or is wrongly remaining on the register.  An \nentry is made without sufficient cause when the entry is contrary to \nthe statutory provisions on the day it is made, whereas and entry \nwrongly remains on the register when, owing the circumstances which \nwere not existing on the day when the entry was made, its continuance \n                                                 \n13 (i) \nF4 Family Group shall have the exclusive right of ownership and use over Bicycle/Automotive \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 25 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

In either case, the registration of \nthe mark has to be shown to be contrary to Section 9, 11 or 12.  \nSection 57(2), submits Mr. Nayar, cannot be used to determine serious \nand disputed contractual issues.  What the petitioner seeks, according \nto him, is a declaration that the petitioner is entitled to own and use \nthe HERO mark for goods in Class 10 under the TMNA.  Such a \ndeclaration could only be given by a Civil Court under the Specific \nRelief Act, and not by the Court, or any other forum, examining an \napplication for rectification under Section 57.   \n \n9.21 For this purpose, Mr. Nayar also relies on Section 45(3)14 of the \nTrade Marks Act which, too, according to him, provides that where \nthe validity of an assignment is in dispute, a Civil Court would first \nhave to adjudicate thereon.  Mutatis mutandis, he would submit, \nwhere the rival rights of the petitioner and Respondent 1 under the \nTMNA are in dispute, a Civil Court has first to adjudicate thereon.  He \nalso submits that, for an adjudication on the rival rights to the use and \nownership of the HERO mark, the petitioner has already instituted an \narbitration, which is in seisin before a learned three Member arbitral \ntribunal.  To support these submissions, Mr. Nayar relies on Janinder \nJain v Registrar of Trade Marks15 and The Financial Times Ltd v. \nThe Times Publishing House Ltd16.  He has also cited some foreign \ndecisions, to which I do not deem it appropriate to refer, as the Court \nhas not been informed of the statutory regime in place in the \njurisdictions where the said decisions were rendered, so that their \n                                                                                                                                     \nTrademarks; \n14 45. \nRegistration of assignments and transmissions.— \n \n \n***** \n(3) Where the validity of an assignment or transmission is in dispute between the parties, the \nRegistrar may refuse to register the assignment or transmission until the rights of the parties have \nbeen determined by a competent court and in all other cases the Registrar shall dispose of the \napplication within the prescribed period. \n15 2003 SCC OnLine Del 550 \n16 2016 SCC OnLine Del 5510 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 26 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

He submits that the \npetitioner could not seek adjudication of private contractual rights \nunder Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act by invoking, for the purpose, \nSection 18.  He further submits that Respondent 1 did not claim \nproprietorial rights to use the HERO GROUP mark for medicinal \nproducts under the TMNA, and there was no material to otherwise \ndiscountenance the claim of Respondent 1, within the four corners of \nthe Trade Marks Act.   \n \n9.23 In fine, Mr. Nayar has reiterated the contention that the \npetitioner, not being the proprietor of the HERO GROUP mark even \nunder Section 18, has no locus standi to maintain the present petition.  \nPer contra, he submits, Respondent 1 is the registered proprietor of \nthe HERO GROUP mark in 39 classes.  There was, therefore, in his \nsubmission, no irregularity in the application, filed by Respondent 1 \nfor registration of the HERO GROUP mark under Class 10 for \nmedical products proceeding to registration.   \n \n10. \nSubmissions of Mr. Sibal in rejoinder \n \n10.1 Apropos Mr. Nayar‘s objections to the maintainability of the \npresent petition, Mr. Sibal responds thus: \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 27 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

He relies, for the purpose, on paras 28 to 33 of \nInfosys Technologies Ltd v. Jupiter Infosys Ltd17 and paras 28 \nto 34 of Hardie Trading Ltd v. Addisons Paint & Chemicals \nLtd18.   \n \n(iii) Besides, the petitioner was a registered partnership firm \nof Vijay Munjal, Rekha Munjal, Naveen Munjal and Gaurav \nMunjal, who were members of the F-1 group.  Hence, they were \n―aggrieved‖ by any prejudice caused to the rights of the F-1 \ngroup.  Mr. Sibal submits, relying on para 3 of N Khadervali \nSaheb v. N Gudu Sahib19, that a partnership firm is not an \nindependent entity, but is only a compendious name by which \nto designate the partners for the sake of convenience.   \nRegistration, too, does not convert the firm into a separate legal \nentity, as held in para 11 of V. Subramanium v. Rajesh \nRaghuvandra Rao20. \n \n(iv) \nBesides, Respondent 1 admitted that the F-1 group could \nuse the HERO ECO mark for medical products.

The petitioner had, thereafter, applied for \nregistration of the HERO ECO mark in its name for medical \nproducts.  In its capacity as such applicant, too, the petitioner \nhad the locus standi to maintain the present petition. \n \n(v) \nWere the petitioner to secure registration of the HERO \nECO mark for medical products, it could sue Respondent 1 for \nusing a deceptively similar mark HERO GROUP for identical \ngoods.  In such a situation, the impugned HERO GROUP \nregistration held by Respondent 1 would afford a complete \ndefence against the suit, in view of Section 28(3)21 of the Trade \nMarks Act.   \n \n(vi) \nThe Power of Attorney dated 13th June 2013, executed \nbetween the F-1 and F-3 groups and relied upon by Respondent \n1 was executed by Vijay Munjal as a partner of the petitioner \nV.R.

(COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 29 of 57    \n \n \n10.2 Mr. Sibal further characterised Mr. Nayar‘s reliance on the \napplication filed by the petitioner for registration of the HERO ECO \nmark for medical products claiming user since 2011 to contend that \nmedical products could not be treated as ―currently manufactured‖ on \n20th May 2010, when the TMNA was executed, as misguided.  The \nissue in controversy, submits Mr. Sibal, is not the date of \ncommencement of use of the mark HERO ECO for medical goods, but \nthe date of commencement of manufacture of medical goods itself.  \n \n10.3 Mr. Nayar‘s plea that the petitioner had acquiesced to the \nentitlement of the F-3 group to own and use the HERO GROUP mark \nfor medical products, submits Mr. Sibal, is unacceptable, being \ncontrary to the covenants of the FSA and TMNA.  He cites, for the \npurpose, Clauses 22.5 and 22.6(b) of the FSA (reproduced earlier). \n  \n10.4 The e-mails exchanged between the parties, submits Mr. Sibal, \ndo not amount to waiver/amendment in writing of Clause 2(v) of the \nTMNA.  Similarly, the removal, by the F-1 group, of the mark HERO \nGROUP from its website did not result, ipso facto, in the creation of a \nright, in favour of the F-3 group, to do so.   \n \n10.5 The Special Power of Attorney executed by the F-1 group in \nfavour of F-3 group, submits Mr. Sibal, does not extend the rights of \nthe F-3 group beyond those conferred by Clauses 2(iii) and (v) of the \nTMNA.  The SPA was merely intended to facilitate international \nregistrations. \n \n10.6 Besides, submits Mr. Sibal, post-contractual correspondence \nbetween the parties could aid interpretation of the contract only where \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

Ltd v. State of Gujarat22.  \n \n10.7 Apropos Mr. Nayar‘s contention that the petition was belated, \nMr. Sibal submits that the law does not stipulate any limitation for \nfiling of a rectification petition.  Khoday Distilleries12 allowed delay \nto be borne in mind as a consideration while examining a rectification \npetition only where it led ―to acquiescence or waiver or \nabandonment‖.  No such delay could be attributed to the petitioner in \nthe present case, as the impugned registration of the HERO GROUP \nmark in favour of Respondent 1 came to the notice of the petitioner in \nSeptember 2020, and the rectification petition was filed in December \n2020.  As the F-3 group was not engaged in any business in medical \nproducts, the petitioner claims not to have noticed the advertising of \nthe application of the F-3 for registration of the impugned mark.  \n \n10.8 Acquiescence, submits Mr. Sibal, requires a positive act, and \nnot merely silence.  He cites, for the proposition, para 26 of Power \nControl Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt Ltd23.  The plea of \nwaiver was also contrary to Clause 22.5 of the FSA (reproduced \nearlier). \n   \n10.9 Mr. Sibal further submits that the circumstances in which \nrectification of the Trade Marks register by removal of a mark \ntherefrom can be sought under Section 57(2) are not restricted to those \nadumbrated in Sections 9 and 11 of the Trade Marks Act.  Section \n57(3), in fact, empowers the Court to decide any question that may be \n                                                 \n22 (1975) 1 SCC 199 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 31 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

P.M. Diesels24 to \ncontend that the civil court is, in fact, bound by the decision in the \nrectification proceeding.  Section 45(3), on which Mr. Nayar relies, \ndeals, as Mr. Sibal points out, with validity of assignment or \ntransmission, and not with validity of a registration.  Mr. Sibal further \nsubmitted that, in view of para 77 of the judgement of the Supreme \nCourt in Vidya Drolia v.

(COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 33 of 57    \n \n \ndocument, indicating any involvement of the petitioner in the \nbusiness of medical products, was forthcoming. \n(ii) \nThe contention, of the petitioner, that it was the ―trade \nmark holding entity‖ of the entire Hero group of companies was \nnot borne out by the documents. The contention was also belied \nby the fact that column (ix) in the format preceding the present \npetition was left blank. \n(iii) The TMNA did not confer any proprietorial right, on the \npetitioner, of the HERO GROUP mark, either for ownership or \nfor use.  Clause 1.1.7 entitled the F-1 group – which the \npetitioner claimed to represent – only to use of the HERO ECO \nmark for medical products.  Even the right to use the mark \nHERO, conferred on the F-1 group by the said clause, was for \nuse of the mark per se, without prefixes or suffixes.  Moreover, \nthe HERO mark, without prefixes or suffixes, too, was made \navailable to the F-1 group only for export of bicycles and \nbicycle parts to selected countries.  The proprietorial \ndispensation of the marks, in favour of the F-1 group, was \nentirely governed by Clause 1.1.7, and was unaffected by the \ninclusion of medical products in Clause 1.1.6(e).  The petitioner \ncould not, therefore, claim to be ―person aggrieved‖ by the \nregistration of the ―HERO GROUP‖ mark, for medical \nproducts, in favour of Respondent 1. \n \n13.2 Mr. Sibal submits, per contra, that the petitioner is a ―person \naggrieved‖ within the meaning of Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act.  \nHe advocates a liberal construction of the expression.

Vijay \nMunjal, Rekha Munjal, Naveen Munjal and Gaurav Munjal could \nhave individually maintained the present suit against the respondents, \nas members of the F-1 group.

The Supreme Court has, in Hari \nShankar Singhania v.

Mr. Sibal is correct in his submission that the \npurity of the register of Trade Marks hangs in the balance.  \n \n13.8 Indeed, the issue appears to be covered by the judgment of the \nSupreme Court in Infosys Technologies Ltd17, on which Mr. Sibal \nplaced reliance.  Section 57(1) uses the expression ―person \naggrieved‖.  Sections 56(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks, Act 1958 \n(―the 1958 Act‖), were the pari materia parallel provisions to Section \n57(1) and (2) of the present Trade Marks Act.  In the context of the \n1958 Act, the Supreme Court, in para 28 to 33 of the report, held thus: \n―28.  \nThe position that emerges from the above provisions is this. \nWhether the application is under Section 46 or under Section 56 or \na composite application under both sections, it is a prerequisite that \nthe applicant must be a person aggrieved. Section 46(1) of the 1958 \nAct enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of \nregistered trade mark from the register on the ground of non-use as \nstated in clause (a) and/or clause (b). To be an aggrieved person \nunder Section 46, he must be one whose interest is affected in \nsome possible way; it must not be a fanciful suggestion of \ngrievance. A likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant \nby such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of \nlocus standi. \n \n29. \n In Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (11th \nEdn.) at p. 166, the legal position with regard to ―person \naggrieved‖ has been summarised thus: \nThe persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in \nsome way or the other substantially interested in having the \nmark removed—where it is a question of removal—from the \nregister; including all persons who would be substantially \ndamaged if the mark remained, and all trade rivals over whom \nan advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the \nbenefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled. \nWe accept the above statement of law. \n \n30.  \nInsofar as Section 56 is concerned, it provides for varying \nsituations in which the person aggrieved may apply for \nrectification of the registered trade mark from the register. \nAlthough both sections, namely, Sections 46 and 56 require the \n―person aggrieved‖ to apply for removal of the registered trade \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 37 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 37 of 57    \n \n \nmark from the register or rectification of a trade mark in the \nregister, the expression ―person aggrieved‖ for the purposes of \nthese two sections has different connotations. \n31.  \nThe interpretation of the expression ―person aggrieved‖ \noccurring in Sections 46 and 56 has come up for consideration \nbefore this Court on more than one occasion. In Hardie Trading \nLtd18 this Court stated as follows: (SCC pp. 105-06, paras 30-34) \n \n―30.  \nThe phrase ‗person aggrieved‘ is a common enough \nstatutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal. The \nphrase has been variously construed depending on the \ncontext in which it occurs. Three sections viz. Sections 46, \n56 and 69 of the Act contain the phrase. Section 46 deals \nwith the removal of a registered trade mark from the \nregister on the ground of non-use. This section presupposes \nthat the registration which was validly made is liable to be \ntaken off by subsequent non-user. Section 56 on the other \nhand deals with situations where the initial registration \nshould not have been or was incorrectly made. The \nsituations covered by this section include: (a) the \ncontravention or failure to observe a condition for \nregistration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) an entry made \nwithout sufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) any \nerror or defect in the entry. Such type of actions are \ncommenced for the ‗purity of the register‘ which it is in \npublic interest to maintain. Applications under Sections 46 \nand 56 may be made to the Registrar who is competent to \ngrant the relief. ‗Persons aggrieved‘ may also apply for \ncancellation or varying an entry in the register relating to a \ncertification trade mark to the Central Government in \ncertain circumstances. Since we are not concerned with a \ncertification trade mark, the process for registration of \nwhich is entirely different, we may exclude the \ninterpretation of the phrase ‗person aggrieved‘ occurring in \nSection 69 from consideration for the purposes of this \njudgment. \n \n31.  \nIn our opinion the phrase ‗person aggrieved‘ for the \npurposes of removal on the ground of non-use under \nSection 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used \nin Section 56 for cancelling or expunging or varying an \nentry wrongly made or remaining in the register. \n \n32.  \nIn the latter case the locus standi would be \nascertained liberally, since it would not only be against the \ninterest of other persons carrying on the same trade but also \nin the interest of the public to have such wrongful entry \nremoved. It was in this sense that the House of Lords \ndefined ‗person aggrieved‘ in Powell's Trade Mark, In \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 38 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

Birmingham \nVinegar Brewery Co.27: (AC p. 10) \n \n      …although they were no doubt inserted to prevent \nofficious interference by those who had no interest at all in \nthe register being correct, and to exclude a mere common \ninformer, it is undoubtedly of public interest that they \nshould not be unduly limited, inasmuch as it is a public \nmischief that there should remain upon the register a mark \nwhich ought not to be there, and by which many persons \nmay be affected, who, nevertheless, would not be willing to \nenter upon the risk and expense of litigation. \n \nWhenever it can be shown, as here, that the applicant is \nin the same trade as the person who has registered the trade \nmark, and wherever the trade mark, if remaining on the \nregister, would, or might, limit the legal rights of the \napplicant, so that by reason of the existence of the entry on \nthe register he could not lawfully do that which, but for the \nexistence of the mark upon the register, he could lawfully \ndo, it appears to me he has a locus standi to be heard as a \nperson aggrieved. \n(emphasis added in Hardie Trading Ltd18 case ) \n \n33.  But if the ground for rectification is merely based on non-\nuser i.e. under Section 46 of the Act, that is not really on \naccount of any public mischief by way of an incorrect entry. \nThe non-user does not by itself render the entry incorrect but it \ngives a right to a person whose interest is affected to apply for \nits removal. An applicant must therefore show that \n‗in some possible way he may be damaged or injured if the \ntrade mark is allowed to stand; and by ―possible‖ I mean \npossible in a practical sense, and not merely in a fantastic \nview…. All cases of this kind, where the original \nregistration is not illegal or improper, ought to be \nconsidered as questions of common sense, to a certain \nextent, at any rate; and I think the applicants ought to show \nsomething approaching a sufficient or proper reason for \napplying to have the trade mark expunged. It certainly is \nnot sufficient reason that they are at loggerheads with the \nrespondents or desire in some way to injure them.‘ \n \n34.  Addisons' application was one under Section 46 and the \ntest to determine whether the applicant was a ‗person \naggrieved‘ within the meaning of that section should have been \nthe one laid down by Romer, J. in Wright case and not the one \npropounded by the House of Lords in the matter of Powell's \n                                                 \n27 1894 AC 8 (HL) \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 39 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

However, it is not \nnecessary to dilate on this aspect of the matter as the appellant \nhas really argued on the second and third aspects of Section 46 \nviz. the alleged non-use of the trade marks by Hardie and \nspecial circumstances.‖ \n \n32.  In Hardie Trading Ltd18  this Court approved the test applied \nby Romer, J. in Royal Baking Powder Co. v. Wright, Crossley and \nCo28. , which has been reproduced in para 33 of the Report. We \nrespectfully agree. \n \n33. \nHardie Trading Ltd18  has been followed by this Court in a \nrecent decision in Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba29 . This Court stated \nthat Section 46 speaks for private interest while Section 56 speaks \nof a public interest. \n \n34.  \nIt is true that the appellant in opposition to the applications \nfor removal/rectification of trade mark did not specifically \nchallenge in its counter-affidavits the locus standi of the first \nrespondent to be heard as a person aggrieved. Obviously, in the \nabsence of any specific objection by the appellant to that effect, no \nspecific issue was framed by the High Court whether the applicant \nwas an aggrieved person. The applications having been transferred \nto IPAB in terms of Section 100 of the 1999 Act, IPAB examined \nthe matter in light of the issues that were framed by the High Court \nalthough in the written submissions before it, the objection was \nraised that the first respondent has ceased to have locus standi in \nview of the subsequent events, particularly change of the name of \nthe first respondent from Jupiter Infosys Ltd. to Jupiter \nInternational Ltd. The question is, whether in these circumstances \nit was incumbent upon IPAB to consider and satisfy itself about the \nlocus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person \naggrieved. In our considered view, it was.‖ \n \nTo the same effect are paras 28 to 34 of the report in Hardie Trading \nLtd.18, which read thus:  \n―(a) Person aggrieved \n \n28. On this issue the Joint Registrar held that Addisons was a \n―person aggrieved‖. The principal ground for doing so was the fact \nthat Addisons carried on the same trade and its applications for \nregistration had been rejected on the ground of the existence of \nHardie's marks. \n \n                                                 \n28 [(1898) 15 RPC 377 \n29 (2008) 10 SCC 766 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 40 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 40 of 57    \n \n \n29.  \nThe learned Single Judge upheld the decision of the \nRegistrar on this issue because Addisons was in the same trade as \nHardie ―and may be able to use the said mark in relation to own \ngoods but for the existence of the registered marks in the name of \nHardie‖. The Division Bench affirmed this view. \n \n30.  \nThe phrase ―person aggrieved‖ is a common enough \nstatutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal. The phrase \nhas been variously construed depending on the context in which it \noccurs. Three sections viz. Sections 46, 56 and 69 of the Act \ncontain the phrase. Section 46 deals with the removal of a \nregistered trade mark from the Register on the ground of non-use. \nThis section presupposes that the registration which was validly \nmade is liable to be taken off by subsequent non-user. Section 56 \non the other hand deals with situations where the initial registration \nshould not have been or was incorrectly made. The situations \ncovered by this section include: (a) the contravention or failure to \nobserve a condition for registration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) \nan entry made without sufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) \nany error or defect in the entry. Such type of actions are \ncommenced for the ―purity of the Register‖ which it is in public \ninterest to maintain. Applications under Sections 46 and 56 may be \nmade to the Registrar who is competent to grant the relief. \n―Persons aggrieved‖ may also apply for cancellation or varying an \nentry in the Register relating to a certification trade mark to the \nCentral Government in certain circumstances. Since we are not \nconcerned with a certification trade mark, the process for \nregistration of which is entirely different, we may exclude the \ninterpretation of the phrase ―person aggrieved‖ occurring in \nSection 69 from consideration for the purposes of this judgment. \n \n31.  \nIn our opinion the phrase ―person aggrieved‖ for the \npurposes of removal on the ground of non-use under Section 46 \nhas a different connotation from the phrase used in Section 56 for \ncancelling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or \nremaining in the Register. \n \n32.  \nIn the latter case the locus standi would be ascertained \nliberally, since it would not only be against the interest of other \npersons carrying on the same trade but also in the interest of the \npublic to have such wrongful entry removed. It was in this sense \nthat the House of Lords defined ―person aggrieved‖ in the matter \nof Powell's Trade Mark27: \n \n―… although they were no doubt inserted to prevent \nofficious interference by those who had no interest at all in \nthe register being correct, and to exclude a mere common \ninformer, it is undoubtedly of public interest that they \nshould not be unduly limited, inasmuch as it is a public \nmischief that there should remain upon the register a mark \nwhich ought not to be there, and by which many persons \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 41 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

As an entity entitled, \nby assignment, to own and use the HERO ECO mark for medical \nproduct, the petitioner can also claim to have the prevailing interest in \nensuring that the competing HERO group mark, for identical medical \nproducts, was not used by any other group or person without due \nsanction in law.  For that reason, too, the petitioner would be entitled \nto maintain the present petition, challenging the registrations granted \nto Respondent 1 of the HERO group for medical products.   \n \n13.11 As such, I reject the contentions of Mr. Nayar that the petitioner \ndid not possess the requisite locus standi to maintain the present \npetition as a ―person aggrieved‖ under Section 57 of the Trade Marks \nAct. \n \n14 \nNon-impleadment of other Family Groups \n \n14.1 Mr. Nayar sought to submit that, as the claim of the petitioner \nwas predicated on the FSA and TMNA, all parties to the FSA and \nTMNA, which would include all Family Groups, were required to be \nimpleaded in the present case.  I cannot agree. \n \n14.2 The challenge in the petition is, plainly and simply, to the \nregistration of the mark HERO GROUP in favour of Respondent 1, as \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 43 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 43 of 57    \n \n \nrepresenting the F-3 Group, in respect of medical products.  The only \nquestion that the Court has to determine is, therefore, whether the F-3 \nGroup was entitled to registration of the HERO GROUP mark in its \nfavour in respect of medical products.  The petitioner, as representing \nthe F-1 Group, contended that the F-3 Group was not entitled to \nregister the HERO GROUP mark in its favour in respect of medical \nproducts.  The F-1 group does not itself claim any entitlement to \nregistration of the HERO GROUP mark, in respect of medical \nproducts or any other goods.  The petitioner‘s contention is that no \ngroup is entitled to register any trade mark for medical products, \nexcept the F-1 group which is entitled to register the HERO ECO \nmark in respect thereof.  The Court has, therefore, to determine the \nentitlement, or otherwise, of the F-3, group, to registration, in its \nfavour, of the HERO GROUP mark for medical goods in the light of \nthese submissions.  \n \n14.3 As such, the rival rights involved were of the F-1 and F-3 \nGroups.  It is nobody‘s case that any of the other Groups was entitled \nto obtain registration in respect of medical products of the HERO \nGROUP mark.  There was, therefore, no requirement of impleading \nany of the other Groups in the present litigation, which is essentially \nbetween the F-1 and F-3 Groups. \n \n15 \nRe: Clause 12.1 of FSA \n \n15.1 Clause 12.1 of the FSA, to my mind, has no application in the \npresent case at all.  We are not concerned, here, with any non-compete \nrestrictions.  Nor does the petitioner invoke any such non-compete \nrestrictions to question the entitlement of Respondent 1 to use the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 44 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

The case of the petitioner \nis predicated on the covenants of the FSA and the TMNA, particularly \nthe TMNA.  If, under the TMNA, Respondent 1 is not entitled to use \nthe HERO GROUP mark for medical products, the registration of the \nmark in favour of Respondent 1 would ex facie be illegal.  There is no \noccasion in so holding to seek recourse to Clause 12.1 of the FSA.   \n \n15.2 The reliance, by Mr. Nayar, on Clause 12.1 of the FSA is, \ntherefore, misguided.     \n \n16 \nRe: Plea of delay \n \n16.1 Mr. Nayar sought to contend that the rectification petition could \nnot be examined on merits, as it was highly belated.  Khoday \nDistilleries12, in his submissions, holds that a belated rectification \npetition cannot be entertained on merits.  Mr. Sibal contends, per \ncontra, that Khoday Distilleries12 applies only where the delay on the \npart of the petitioner has led to acquiescence, waiver or abandonment. \n   \n16.2 The answer to Mr. Nayar‘s contention is, in fact, to be found in \npara 49 of Khoday Distilleries12 itself.  In the said paragraph, the \nSupreme Court holds that ―delay would be a valid defence where it \nhas caused a change in the subject matter and action or brought about \na situation in which justice cannot be done‖.   The paragraphs that \nprecede para 42 in Khoday Distilleries12, as Mr. Sibal correctly points \nout, essentially deal with the aspects of acquiescence and waiver. \n \n16.3 In the present case, there is nothing to indicate that, prior to \nSeptember 2020, the registration of the HERO GROUP mark in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 45 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

It \ncannot, therefore, be said that the rectification petition was belated in \nany way. \n \n16.4 The submission of delay, as advanced by Mr. Nayar, is also, \ntherefore, rejected. \n \n17. \nRe: Section 45(3) and contention that rights emanating from \nprivate contract cannot be examined in rectification petition under \nSection 57 \n \n17.1 Mr. Nayar contends that Section 45(3) of the Trade Marks Act, \nin conjunction with the principle on the rights arising from a civil \ncontract cannot be adjudicated in rectification proceedings, forbears \nthis Court to, in the present proceedings which have been instituted \nunder Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act, return findings regarding \nthe rival rights of the parties before the Court, as they arise from the \ncovenants of the FSA and the TMNA. \n \n17.2 The submission, in my opinion, is devoid of substance. \n \n17.3 Section 45 of the Trademarks Act deals with registrations of \nassignments and transmissions.  Sub-section (1) thereunder requires a \nperson, who becomes entitled to a registered trademark by assignment \nor transmission, to apply to the Registrar to register him as the \nproprietor of the trademark, providing, in the process, the particulars \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 46 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 46 of 57    \n \n \nof such assignment or transmission.  Sub-section (2) empowers the \nRegistrar, in such a case, to require the applicant to furnish evidence \nof proof of title in the event of reasonable doubt about the veracity of \nthe statement and document furnished by him.  Sub-section (3), which \nMr. Nayar invokes, provides that, where the validity of the assignment \nor transmission is in dispute between the parties, the Registrar can \nrefuse to register the assignment or transmission till the rights of the \nparties are determined by a competent court.  This clause, therefore, \napplies only where an application has been filed before the Registrar \nfor registering the applicant as the proprietor of a trademark which \nalready stands registered in favour of someone else, on the basis of \nassignment or transmission of the said mark made by such other \nperson in his favour.  In such a case, when the parties are already \nlocked in litigation with respect to the validity of the document of \nassignment or transmission, Section 45(3) permits the Registrar to \nrefuse to register the applicant as the proprietor of the mark till such \ndispute is decided by the competent civil court.   \n \n17.4 Here, the petitioner is not asserting its right, or questioning the \nright of Respondent 1 to registration of the HERO GROUP mark in \nrespect of medical products, on the basis of any assignment or \ntransmission of the right to the said mark by an earlier holder thereof.   \nThe FSA and TMNA cannot be regarded as documents of assignment \nor transmission of marks.  They divide, among the various Family \nGroups, the right to use the different marks in respect of specified \ngoods.  It is not, therefore, as though the HERO GROUP mark stood \nearlier registered in favour of someone else, who assigned the right to \nthe mark either to the F-1 Group or to the F-3 Group or any other \nfamily group. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 47 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 47 of 57    \n \n \n \n17.5 Secondly, Mr. Nayar has not drawn my attention to any \nproceedings in which the validity of any such document of assignment \nor transmission of the right to use the HERO GROUP mark in respect \nof medical products was transferred by one party to another was under \nchallenge. \n \n17.6 The prerequisites of Section 45 do not, therefore, apply in the \npresent case. \n \n17.7 I am also not impressed with Mr. Nayar‘s submission that, in \nrectification proceedings, the Court or the authority adjudicating the \nmatter cannot examine civil contractual rights.  The submission is, in \nmy considered opinion, in the teeth of Section 18 of the Trademarks \nAct.  Section 18 requires any application for registration of a mark to \nbe made by the proprietor of the mark.  The establishment of \nproprietorial rights in respect of a mark is, therefore, a sine qua non, \nbefore registration of the mark can be sought.  Where, as in the \npresent case, the right of the registrant to registration of the mark is \nquestioned under Section 57 on the ground that the registrant does not \nhave proprietorial rights over the mark, the Section 57 Court would \nnecessarily have to examine the issue.  Examination of the existence \nor otherwise of proprietorial rights would, in most cases, involve \nexamination of contractual provisions. \n \n17.8 Though Sections 9 and 11 of the Trademarks contain absolute \nand relative grounds on which registration can be refused, they do not \ndetract from the requirement, engrafted in Section 18(1) of the \nTrademarks Act, for the applicant seeking registration of a mark to be \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 48 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 48 of 57    \n \n \nrequired to claim himself to be the proprietor of such mark.  The \nsequitur would, therefore, be that a person questioning the validity of \nthe registration of the mark in favour of another, can always base the \nchallenge on the lack of proprietorial rights of such other person to the \nmark which stands registered in his favour. \n \n17.9 Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act does not, in any manner, \nfetter or restrict the scope of inquiry or investigation which the Court, \napproached under the said provision, is empowered to undertake.  As \nsuch, I am unable to subscribe to Mr. Nayar‘s contention that civil \nrights emanating from a contract cannot be adjudicated in a \nrectification proceeding under Section 57 of the Trademarks Act.  The \ncontention is, therefore, rejected. \n \n18. \nThe rival rights of the parties on merits \n \n18.1 Coming, now, to the meat of the matter.  \n \n18.2 The F-3 Group claims its right to registration of the HERO \nGROUP mark for medical products under Clause 2(iii) read with \nClauses 1.1.8 to 1.1.11 and Clause 2(ix) of the TMNA.  The F-1 \nGroup, as represented by the petitioner, does not claim any right to \nownership or use of the HERO GROUP mark for medical products.  \nThe petitioner‘s case is, however, that by conjoint reading of Clauses \n1.1.6(e) and 1.1.7(c), registration of any mark for medical products is \npermissible only in favour of the F-1 Group, of the HERO ECO mark.  \nClauses 1.1.6(e) and 1.1.7(c), therefore, read in conjunction, foreclose \nthe right of any other Group to seek registration of any mark in its \nfavour for medical products.  This, therefore, would extend to the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 49 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

Medical products, the F-1 group would \ntherefore urge, are its personal fiefdom. \n \n18.3 A careful reading of the FSA and the TMNA persuades me to \naccept the submission of Mr. Nayar and reject that of Mr. Sibal.  To \nunderstand why I so hold, one may view the matter, first, from the \npoint of view of the rights of the F-3 group under the TMNA and, \nthereafter, the rights of the F-1 group under the TMNA, in respect of \nregistration of trade marks for medical products. \n \n18.4 Re: Right of F-3 Group \n \n18.4.1 \nClause 2(iii) confers exclusive right of ownership and use \nover ―Other Products and Services Trademarks‖ and ―Future Products \nand Services Trademarks‖ on the F-3 Group. \n \n18.4.2 \n―Other Products and Services Trademarks‖ are defined as \nthe trade mark and name HERO with or without suffixes, used in \nrelation to Other Products and Services. The expression ―HERO with \nor without suffixes‖ would, needless to say, include HERO GROUP. \n \n18.4.3 \nThe definition of ―Other Products and Services‖ in \nClause 1.1.8 specifically excludes ―F-1 Family Group Products and \nServices‖.  \n \n18.4.4 \nClauses 1.1.6 which defines ―F-1 Family Groups Product \nand Services‖ specifically includes in sub clause (e), ―Medical \nProducts & Lifestyle Care equipment for Hospitals, Rehabilitation and \nHomes‖.   \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 50 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

P. Ramanatha Aiyar, in his Advanced Law Lexicon (5th \nedition) defines ―current‖ as ―running; now passing or present in his \nprogress‖ and, alternately, as ―describing continuing state of affairs \nthat is occurring or relevant at the present time and is expected to \nremain so and in the near future‖.  Existence at the present time is, \ntherefore, essential for something to be treated as ―current‖.

The BRA, on which Mr. Sibal relies, is dated 30th November \n2011.  The BRA does not indicate, anywhere that, on the date of \nexecution of the TMNA, i.e. on 20th May 2010, medical products were \nbeing manufactured by the HERO GROUP of companies. \n \n18.4.11 \nMr. Sibal also sought to contend that, apart from facts, \nthe covenants of the TMNA required medical products to be treated as \n―currently manufactured‖.  For this, he advances three contentions, \nnone of which, however, supports his submission. \n \n18.4.12 \nMr. Sibal submits, firstly, that Clauses 1.1.8 and 1.1.6(e) \nof the TMNA, when juxtaposed, deem medical products to be \ncurrently manufactured.  The submission, on its face, is difficult to \naccept.  Whether an article is, or is not, currently manufactured, is a \nquestion of fact, and a fairly simple one at that.  Any concept of \n―deemed current manufacture‖ is, therefore, on its face illogical.  That \napart, the logic Mr. Sibal presses into service, to support his \nsubmission, is also, in my view, inherently fallacious.  Mr. Sibal seeks \nto submit that, as the definition of ―Other Products and Services‖ in \nClause 1.1.8, which means all types of goods currently manufactured \nexcludes ―F-1 Family Group Products and Services‖, and ―F-1 Family \nGroup Products and Services‖ as defined in Clause 1.1.6 includes, in \nclause (e), medical products, therefore, medical products would be \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 52 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 52 of 57    \n \n \ndeemed to stand included in all types of goods currently \nmanufactured. \n \n18.4.13 \nI fail to see how. \n \n18.4.14 \nThe definition of ―Other Products and Services‖ in Clause \n1.1.8 does mean all types of goods currently manufactured, and does \nexclude F-1 Family Group Products and Services, but that does not \nmean, by any principle known to logic, that all products enumerated in \nthe definition of ―F-1 Family Group Products and Services‖, as \ncontained in Clause 1.1.6, must necessarily be deemed, by the TMNA, \nto be currently manufactured.  The contention, in effect, interprets \nClause 1.1.8 effectively in reverse.  All that the exclusionary part of \nthe Clause does is to exclude, from the ambit of the Clause, goods and \nservices covered by Clause 1.1.6.  By no known principle of logic can \nit be inferred, from this, that all goods and services enumerated in \nClause 1.1.6 are thereby deemed to be currently manufactured.  The \nargument is, therefore, fundamentally illogical.   \n \n18.4.15 \nIf ―A‖ is defined as potatoes, cabbages, carrots and \napples, and ―B‖ is defined as all vegetables other than A, does it mean \nthat apples are deemed to be vegetables?  The answer, to my mind, is \nobviously ‗no‘.  It would, at best, only mean that potatoes, cabbages \nand tomatoes would not be included in A.  Apples would not be \naffected by the definition of ‗A‘ precisely because apple is not a \nvegetable.  To read the two clauses as deeming apples to be vegetables \nis, therefore, turning the definition of ‗A‘ on its head.  Which is what, \nwith respect, Mr. Sibal‘s submission does to Clause 1.1.8 of the \nTMNA. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 53 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 53 of 57    \n \n \n \n18.4.16 \nMr. Sibal next submits that, if medical products were to \nbe included in the ―Future Products and Services‖ under Clause \n1.1.10, it would create conflict between Clauses 1.1.6(e), read with \nClause 1.1.8, and Clause 1.1.10, as Clause 1.1.10 would then be \nincluding medical products which Clause 1.1.8, read with Clause \n1.1.6(e), specifically excludes.  This submission, too, is ex facie \nunacceptable.  The reason is obvious.  Clause 2(iii) independently \nentitles the F-3 group to rights of ownership and use over Other \nProducts and Services Trade Marks and Future Products and Services \nTrade Marks.  Including, in one (Clause 1.1.10), what is not includible \nin the other (Clause 1.1.8) does not, therefore, in any manner infract \nthe TMNA.    \n \n18.4.17 \nMr. Sibal lastly submits, on this issue, that including \nmedical products within the definition of ―Future Products and \nServices‖ in Clause 1.1.10 would violate Clause 1.1.7(c), as the F-3 \ngroup would, then, become entitled to use even the HERO ECO mark \nfor medical products.  Again, the submission fails to impress.  All that \nis needed is a harmonious interpretation of Clause 1.1.7(c) and Clause \n1.1.10, in the light of their parent clauses 2(ii) and 2(iii).  Inasmuch as \nClauses 2(ii) and 2(iii) confer exclusive rights to the F-1 and F-3 \ngroups over, in the former case, F-1 Family Group Trade Marks and, \nin the latter, Other Products and Services Trade Marks and Future \nProducts and Services Trade Marks, it is obvious that the clauses have \nto be harmoniously read, so as not to efface each other out.  So read, \nClause 2(iii), read with Clause 1.1.10, would entitle the F-3 group to \nexclusive use of the HERO GROUP mark for all goods not currently \nmanufactured – which would  include medical products – and Clause \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 54 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

The \nattempt of Mr. Sibal to invoke Clause 1.1.7(c) so as to deny, to Clause \n1.1.10, its legitimate scope and ambit cannot, therefore, sustain. \n \n18.4.18 \nResultantly, it cannot be held that, even contractually, \nmedical products were ―currently manufactured‖.   \n \n18.4.19 \nThe decisions in Ramdev Food Products3, Bangalore \nElectricity Supply Co Ltd4, Investors Compensation Scheme5, Jumbo \nKing6 and Phoenix Commercial Enterprises7 do not further the case \nthat Mr. Sibal seeks to espouse. Mr. Sibal primarily relied on these \nauthorities to submit that the covenants of the FSA and TMNA had to \nbe construed in harmony with trade mark law, as contained in the \nTrade Marks Act.  There can be no gainsaying the proposition that \nevery contract has to be interpreted in accordance with extant law.  \nHowever, as the manner in which I have chosen to interpret the \nvarious competing clauses of the TMNA does no insult to the Trade \nMarks Act, I do not deem it necessary to advert to each of these \ndecisions.   \n \n18.4.20 \nClause 1.1.10 cannot, therefore, be said to disentitle the \nF-3 Group from registration of the HERO GROUP trademark in its \nfavour in respect of medical products; on the other hand, it permits \nsuch registration. \n \n18.4.21 \nIn view thereof, it is not necessary to pronounce on \nClause 2(ix) but as Mr. Nayar has invoked the said provision, I deem \nit appropriate to observe that Clause 2(ix) cannot enure in favour of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 55 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

There is no clause, in the TMNA, which \nproscribes registration of any mark other than HERO ECO, in respect \nof medical products, in favour of any of the Family Groups. \n \n18.5.2 \nIn this context, it has to be borne in mind that \n(a) \nthe right of the F-1 Group to ownership and use of the \ntrademarks is covered by Clause 2(ii) of the TMNA, \n(b)  \nClause 2(ii) gives the F-1 Group exclusive right of \nownership and use over F-1 Family Group Trademarks, and not \nover all trademarks in respect of F-1 Family Group Products \nand Services,  \n(c) \nthe TMNA, therefore, confers exclusivity, on the F-1 \ngroup, only in respect of F-1 Family Group Trademarks \n(defined in Clause 1.1.7), and not in respect of F-1 Family \nGroup Products and Services (defined in Clause 1.1.6), \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 56 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001633 \nC.O.

Holdings, claimed to be the \"trade mark holding entity\" of the Hero group of companies. However, the documents did not support this claim, and the Trademark Non-Disclosure Agreement (TMNA) did not confer any proprietorial right to the HERO GROUP mark on the petitioner. The court noted that the petitioner could not claim to be a \"person aggrieved\" by the registration of the HERO GROUP mark for medical products in favor of Respondent 1.

Mr. Sibal is correct in his submission that the \npurity of the register of Trade Marks hangs in the balance.  \n \n13.8 Indeed, the issue appears to be covered by the judgment of the \nSupreme Court in Infosys Technologies Ltd17, on which Mr. Sibal \nplaced reliance.  Section 57(1) uses the expression ―person \naggrieved‖.  Sections 56(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks, Act 1958 \n(―the 1958 Act‖), were the pari materia parallel provisions to Section \n57(1) and (2) of the present Trade Marks Act.  In the context of the \n1958 Act, the Supreme Court, in para 28 to 33 of the report, held thus: \n―28.  \nThe position that emerges from the above provisions is this. \nWhether the application is under Section 46 or under Section 56 or \na composite application under both sections, it is a prerequisite that \nthe applicant must be a person aggrieved. Section 46(1) of the 1958 \nAct enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of \nregistered trade mark from the register on the ground of non-use as \nstated in clause (a) and/or clause (b). To be an aggrieved person \nunder Section 46, he must be one whose interest is affected in \nsome possible way; it must not be a fanciful suggestion of \ngrievance. A likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant \nby such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of \nlocus standi. \n \n29. \n In Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (11th \nEdn.) at p. 166, the legal position with regard to ―person \naggrieved‖ has been summarised thus: \nThe persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in \nsome way or the other substantially interested in having the \nmark removed—where it is a question of removal—from the \nregister; including all persons who would be substantially \ndamaged if the mark remained, and all trade rivals over whom \nan advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the \nbenefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled. \nWe accept the above statement of law. \n \n30.  \nInsofar as Section 56 is concerned, it provides for varying \nsituations in which the person aggrieved may apply for \nrectification of the registered trade mark from the register. \nAlthough both sections, namely, Sections 46 and 56 require the \n―person aggrieved‖ to apply for removal of the registered trade \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified",

Section 46 deals with removal of a registered trade mark due to non-use, while Section 56 deals with cancellation or expunging of an entry wrongly made or remaining in the register. The court liberally ascertains locus standi in the latter case, considering it in the interest of the public to remove wrongful entries.

In Hardie Trading \nLtd18 this Court stated as follows: (SCC pp. 105-06, paras 30-34) \n \n―30.  \nThe phrase ‗person aggrieved‘ is a common enough \nstatutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal. The \nphrase has been variously construed depending on the \ncontext in which it occurs. Three sections viz. Sections 46, \n56 and 69 of the Act contain the phrase. Section 46 deals \nwith the removal of a registered trade mark from the \nregister on the ground of non-use. This section presupposes \nthat the registration which was validly made is liable to be \ntaken off by subsequent non-user. Section 56 on the other \nhand deals with situations where the initial registration \nshould not have been or was incorrectly made. The \nsituations covered by this section include: (a) the \ncontravention or failure to observe a condition for \nregistration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) an entry made \nwithout sufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) any \nerror or defect in the entry. Such type of actions are \ncommenced for the ‗purity of the register‘ which it is in \npublic interest to maintain. Applications under Sections 46 \nand 56 may be made to the Registrar who is competent to \ngrant the relief. ‗Persons aggrieved‘ may also apply for \ncancellation or varying an entry in the register relating to a \ncertification trade mark to the Central Government in \ncertain circumstances. Since we are not concerned with a \ncertification trade mark, the process for registration of \nwhich is entirely different, we may exclude the \ninterpretation of the phrase ‗person aggrieved‘ occurring in \nSection 69 from consideration for the purposes of this \njudgment. \n \n31.  \nIn our opinion the phrase ‗person aggrieved‘ for the \npurposes of removal on the ground of non-use under \nSection 46 has a different connotation from the phrase used \nin Section 56 for cancelling or expunging or varying an \nentry wrongly made or remaining in the register. \n \n32.  \nIn the latter case the locus standi would be \nascertained liberally, since it would not only be against the \ninterest of other persons carrying on the same trade but also \nin the interest of the public to have such wrongful entry \nremoved.

However, if the ground for rectification is based on non-user, the applicant must show that they may be damaged or injured if the trade mark is allowed to stand.

The learned Single Judge and Division Bench upheld the decision that Addisons, being in the same trade as Hardie, may be considered a \"person aggrieved\". The court notes that the phrase has different connotations in Sections 46 and 56 of the Act, with Section 56 allowing for a more liberal interpretation to remove wrongful entries from the Register in the public interest. The case is V.R. Holdings v. Hero Investcorp Limited, with Neutral Citation Number 2023/DHC/001633, and was pronounced on March 6, 2023.

(COMM.IPD-TM) 163/2021 \n \nPage 40 of 57    \n \n \n29.  \nThe learned Single Judge upheld the decision of the \nRegistrar on this issue because Addisons was in the same trade as \nHardie ―and may be able to use the said mark in relation to own \ngoods but for the existence of the registered marks in the name of \nHardie‖. The Division Bench affirmed this view. \n \n30.  \nThe phrase ―person aggrieved‖ is a common enough \nstatutory precondition for a valid complaint or appeal. The phrase \nhas been variously construed depending on the context in which it \noccurs. Three sections viz. Sections 46, 56 and 69 of the Act \ncontain the phrase. Section 46 deals with the removal of a \nregistered trade mark from the Register on the ground of non-use. \nThis section presupposes that the registration which was validly \nmade is liable to be taken off by subsequent non-user. Section 56 \non the other hand deals with situations where the initial registration \nshould not have been or was incorrectly made. The situations \ncovered by this section include: (a) the contravention or failure to \nobserve a condition for registration; (b) the absence of an entry; (c) \nan entry made without sufficient cause; (d) a wrong entry; and (e) \nany error or defect in the entry. Such type of actions are \ncommenced for the ―purity of the Register‖ which it is in public \ninterest to maintain. Applications under Sections 46 and 56 may be \nmade to the Registrar who is competent to grant the relief. \n―Persons aggrieved‖ may also apply for cancellation or varying an \nentry in the Register relating to a certification trade mark to the \nCentral Government in certain circumstances. Since we are not \nconcerned with a certification trade mark, the process for \nregistration of which is entirely different, we may exclude the \ninterpretation of the phrase ―person aggrieved‖ occurring in \nSection 69 from consideration for the purposes of this judgment. \n \n31.  \nIn our opinion the phrase ―person aggrieved‖ for the \npurposes of removal on the ground of non-use under Section 46 \nhas a different connotation from the phrase used in Section 56 for \ncancelling or expunging or varying an entry wrongly made or \nremaining in the Register. \n \n32.  \nIn the latter case the locus standi would be ascertained \nliberally, since it would not only be against the interest of other \npersons carrying on the same trade but also in the interest of the \npublic to have such wrongful entry removed. It was in this sense \nthat the House of Lords defined ―person aggrieved‖ in the matter \nof Powell's Trade Mark27: \n \n―… although they were no doubt inserted to prevent \nofficious interference by those who had no interest at all in \nthe register being correct, and to exclude a mere common \ninformer, it is undoubtedly of public interest that they \nshould not be unduly limited, inasmuch as it is a public \nmischief that there should remain upon the register a mark \nwhich ought not to be there, and by which many persons \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:06.03.2023\n15:20:55\nSignature Not Verified",

Holdings, argues that only the F-1 Group has the right to seek registration of any mark for medical products, based on Clauses 1.1.6(e) and 1.1.7(c) of the TMNA. The court is weighing the rival rights of the parties and considering the validity of the registration of the mark in favor of Hero Investcorp Limited. (Source: V.R. Holdings v.

The contention, in effect, interprets \nClause 1.1.8 effectively in reverse.  All that the exclusionary part of \nthe Clause does is to exclude, from the ambit of the Clause, goods and \nservices covered by Clause 1.1.6.  By no known principle of logic can \nit be inferred, from this, that all goods and services enumerated in \nClause 1.1.6 are thereby deemed to be currently manufactured.
