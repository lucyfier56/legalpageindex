    "decision_summary": "**Background**\n\nThe case involves a trade mark dispute between Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha (Toyota) and Tech Square Engineering Pvt. Ltd. (Tech Square) over the use of the trade mark \"ALPHARD\". Toyota, a Japanese automotive manufacturer, has been using the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark since 1986 for its luxury MUV, which was launched in 2002. Although the vehicle has not been formally launched in India, it has been available in the country through direct import for many years.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nThe legal issues in this case involve the rectification of the trade mark register to remove registrations granted in favor of Tech Square for the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark in various classes, including Class 9 (car radios/stereos, navigation apparatus for vehicles), Class 12 (automobiles and car accessories), and Class 27 (automobile carpets). Toyota seeks to have these registrations removed, claiming that they are unauthorized and infringe on its well-known trade mark.\n\n**Arguments**\n\nToyota argued that it has prior use and reputation in the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark, which has been used worldwide, including in India, for many years. Toyota claimed that Tech Square's registration of the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark in various classes is likely to cause confusion among consumers and dilute the distinctiveness of its well-known trade mark.\n\nTech Square, on the other hand, argued that it had registered the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark in good faith and had been using it in India for many years without any objection from Toyota. Tech Square claimed that Toyota's failure to launch its \"ALPHARD\" vehicle in India and its lack of use of the trade mark in the country meant that it had abandoned its rights to the trade mark.\n\n**Court Findings**\n\nThe court, after considering the arguments and evidence presented by both parties, found that Toyota had established prior use and reputation in the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark. The court also found that Tech Square's registration of the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark in various classes was likely to cause confusion among consumers and dilute the distinctiveness of Toyota's well-known trade mark.\n\n**Decision**\n\nThe court ruled in favor of Toyota, ordering the rectification of the trade mark register to remove the registrations granted in favor of Tech Square for the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark in Class 9, Class 12, and Class 27. The court held that Tech Square's registration of the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark was unauthorized and infringed on Toyota's well-known trade mark.\n\nThe court's decision is based on the principles of trade mark law, which prioritize the protection of well-known trade marks and prevent the unauthorized use of such marks by third parties. The decision also reflects the court's consideration of the potential harm that could be caused to Toyota's reputation and business if Tech Square were allowed to continue using the \"ALPHARD\" trade mark in India.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of protecting well-known trade marks and preventing unauthorized use by third parties. The decision also demonstrates the court's consideration of the potential harm that could be caused to a company's reputation and business if an unauthorized use of its trade mark is allowed to continue. The case serves as a reminder to companies to actively monitor and protect their trade marks, particularly in jurisdictions where they have a significant presence or reputation.",

Counter statements thereto have been filed on behalf \nof the respondent no.1 and rejoinder has been filed on behalf of the \npetitioner company. \n3. \nSince all the three petitions raise similar issues, they are being decided \nby way of a common judgment. \nBRIEF FACTS \n4. \nBriefly, the case set up by the petitioner company is as under: \n4.1 \nThe petitioner company, incorporated in Japan, is an automotive \nmanufacturer and operates throughout the world.  The vehicles of the \npetitioner company are sold in more than 170 countries and the \npetitioner company conducts business worldwide with 53 overseas \nmanufacturing companies in 28 countries and regions.  \n4.2 \nThe petitioner company entered the Indian market in a joint venture \nwith the Kirloskar Group in 1997 known as Toyota Kirloskar Motor \nPvt. Ltd. and set up manufacturing facilities in India.   \n4.3 \nThe petitioner company owns various distinctive and well-known \ntrademarks, one of which includes the trade mark „ALPHARD‟. The \naforesaid trade mark was adopted by the petitioner company in the \nyear 1986 and a luxury MUV under the said brand was launched in \nthe year 2002. \n4.4 \nThough, the petitioner company‟s vehicle under the trade mark \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

The earliest registration of the \npetitioner company‟s mark „ALPHARD‟ dates back to 1986 and the \nsaid trade mark is registered in various jurisdictions, such as Japan, \nChina, Singapore etc.   \n4.5 \nThe petitioner company has sold more than 8,50,000 units under the \ntrade mark „ALPHARD‟ since its launch in 2002.  The details of sales \nfigures as well as advertising and promotional expenses incurred by \nthe petitioner company from 2002-2017 have been given in the \npetition. \n4.6 \nThe petitioner company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ is well-known \nthroughout the world and has acquired a secondary meaning with the \npeople associated with the trade associating the same with the \npetitioner. \n4.7 \nThe petitioner company applied for registration of the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟ on a „proposed to be used basis‟ on 21st November, \n2017 and the same has been objected to by the Registry.  \n4.8 \nThe respondent no.1 obtained registration of the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟ under Classes 9, 12 and 27 on 5th November, 2015 on a \n„proposed to be used basis‟. \n4.9 \nAdoption of the petitioner company‟s trade mark by the respondent \nno.1 in relation to goods in the allied/cognate field has been done in a \nmala fide manner so as to trade upon the petitioner company‟s \ngoodwill and reputation.   \n5. \nThe case of the defendants in the counter statement can be \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

Reliance is placed on \nprintouts from third-party websites showing listings of the petitioner \ncompany‟s vehicles in India for sale. \n6.2 \nPetitioner company‟s trade mark „ALPHARD‟ enjoys a worldwide \nreputation and the same has a direct spillover in India. In this regard, \npetitioner \ncompany \nhas \nplaced \non \nrecord \ninternational \nbrochures/annual reports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration \ncertificates/renewal certificates and promotional material in respect of \nthe mark „ALPHARD‟.  \n6.3 \nThe invoices placed on record on behalf of the respondent no.1 are \nnot of the respondent no.1 company but of „Tekstar Global Private \nLimited‟.   \n6.4 \nRegistration could not have been granted to the respondent no.1 in \nterms of Sections 11(1), 11(2), 11(3) and 11(10) of the Trade Marks \nAct, 1999 (hereinafter „the Act‟).   \n6.5 \nReliance is placed on the judgment of a Division Bench of this Court \nin MAC Personal Care Pvt.

Further, the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ \nhas not been used by the petitioner company in Classes 9 or 27 even \noutside India. \n7.2 \nThe products of the respondent no.1 have been continuously sold \nunder the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ since the year 2015.  Reliance in \nthis regard is placed on the invoices of „Tekstar Global Private \nLimited‟, sister company of the respondent no.1.   \n7.3 \nThe word „ALPHARD‟ is the name of a star and therefore, the same \nhas been adopted by the respondent no.1 in a bona fide manner.  Its \nuse in relation to car accessories is completely arbitrary and fanciful.  \n7.4 \nThe provisions of Sections 11(1), 11(2) and 11(3) of the Act have no \napplication in the present case as there is no earlier registered trade \nmark in the present case.   \n7.5 \nReliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Toyota \nJidosha Kabushiki Kaisha v. Prius Auto Industries Ltd., (2018) 2 \nSCC 1 and the order of IPAB in Hypnos Limited v. Hosur Coir \nFoam Pvt. Ltd. and Ors., 2015 SCC OnLine IPAB 213, to contend \nthat in the present case, there is no transnational reputation available \nto the petitioner company in India.  \nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS \n8. \nI have heard the counsel for the parties and perused the record. \n9. \nThe Supreme Court in the petitioner company‟s own case, Toyota \n(supra), though relating to a passing off action, has laid down the principles \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 298/2022 with connected matters                                                     Page 8 of 19 \n \nfor determining transnational reputation. It was the case of Toyota that the \ncar under the brand „Prius‟ was launched in Japan in 1997 and in other \ncountries in 2000-2001. However, „Prius‟ was released in India in the year \n2009 and formally launched in the year 2010. The respondent (defendant in \nthe suit), had got the mark „Prius‟ registered in India in 2002 in respect of \nauto parts and accessories and was using the said mark in India since 2001. \nA suit for infringement of the mark „Prius‟ and passing off was filed by \nToyota against the respondent. After a full trial, a Single Judge of this Court \nheld that the acts of the respondent amounted to passing off of the \nrespondent‟s goods under the trade name „Prius‟ and consequently granted a \npermanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff. In appeal, the Division \nBench reversed the judgment of the Single Judge and declined the relief of \npermanent injunction. This was challenged by Toyota before the Supreme \nCourt.  \n10. \nRelying upon the judgments of the Courts in the U.K. and Australia \nand the passages from the book „The Law of Passing-Off‟ by Prof. \nChristopher Wadlow, the Supreme Court applied the „territoriality \nprinciple‟ and held that the transnational reputation of Toyota in respect of \nthe trade mark 'Prius‟ has not spilled over to India and hence, did not grant \npermanent injunction in favour of Toyota. The relevant observations of the \nSupreme Court with regard to the application of the „territoriality principle‟ \nare set out below: \n“32.  \nProf. Cristopher Wadlow's view on the subject appears to \nbe that the test of whether a foreign claimant may succeed in a \npassing-off action is whether his business has a goodwill in a \nparticular jurisdiction, which criterion is broader than the \n“obsolete” test of whether a claimant has a business/place of \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 298/2022 with connected matters                                                     Page 9 of 19 \n \nbusiness in that jurisdiction. If there are customers for the \nclaimant's products in that jurisdiction, then the claimant stands \nin the same position as a domestic trader. \n \n33.  \nThe overwhelming judicial and academic opinion all over \nthe globe, therefore, seems to be in favour of the territoriality \nprinciple. We do not see why the same should not apply to this \ncountry. \n \n34.  \nTo give effect to the territoriality principle, the courts \nmust necessarily have to determine if there has been a spillover \nof the reputation and goodwill of the mark used by the claimant \nwho has brought the passing-off action. In the course of such \ndetermination it may be necessary to seek and ascertain the \nexistence of not necessarily a real market but the presence of \nthe claimant through its mark within a particular territorial \njurisdiction in a more subtle form which can best be manifested \nby the following illustrations, though they arise from decisions of \ncourts which may not be final in that particular jurisdiction.” \n \n11. \nApplying the aforesaid principles to the facts of the case before the \nSupreme Court in Toyota (supra), it was observed as under: \n(i) \nUndoubtedly, the trade mark „Prius‟ has acquired a great deal of \ngoodwill in various other jurisdictions in the world before its use and \nregistration by the respondent in India. \n(ii) \nMerely on account of advertisements in automobile magazines, \ninternational business magazines and information on the internet, it \ncannot be said that the aforesaid product has acquired the necessary \ngoodwill and reputation in the Indian market. \n(iii) The evidence on record also showed very limited sales of the product \nin the Indian market and no advertisement prior to the registration by \nthe defendant. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

In the said case, the applicant was the registered proprietor of the \nmark „Hypnos‟, adopted several decades ago in relation to beds, mattresses, \npillows, etc.  It was also the case of the applicant that beds bearing the trade \nmark „Hypnos‟ had been supplied by the applicant to hotels in India in the \nyears 2008 to 2010.  The respondent‟s trade mark was registered in Class 20 \nin the year 2007. It was the case of the applicant that the respondent had \ndishonestly adopted and obtained registration of the trade mark „Hypnos‟ in \nIndia and started using the same for selling similar goods. Rejecting the \nsubmission of the applicant that the impugned trade mark „Hypnos‟ is a \n„well-known trademark‟ and carries transborder reputation, which has \nspilled over to India, the IPAB dismissed the rectification petition. The \nrelevant observations are as under: \n“81.  \nWe agree with the proposition propounded in the \njudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court on same issue, wherein the \nHon'ble Apex court has held that in the case of National Sewing \nThread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. (Supra). \n \n“Wherein the Hon'ble court has taken view that “the suit of \npassing-off and the opposition proceedings pending before \nthe Registrar of Trademarks are different from each other”. \n \n82.  \nWe are also of the same opinion as this proposition lay \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

The rectification proceedings \nbefore the board under section 57 of the trademarks Act cannot \nbe equated to be similar with as in the case of passing off action, \nwhere the burden rests on the plaintiff to prove whether there is \nlikelihood of the defendant's goods being passed off as the goods \nof the plaintiff but in rectification proceedings under section 57 \nof the trademarks Act it deals with the power to cancel or vary \nregistration on many grounds and to expunge the trademark from \nthe register is based on different tenets altogether not as in the \ncase suit for passing off, as such the rectification application also \nhas inherent different structure in totality than the suit of passing \noff. \n \n83.  \nTo claim Trans-border reputation for a mark in India, \nthe impugned trademark ‘Hypnos’ must be well known \nsubstantial segment of consumers in India must know about the \nexistence of the mark of the foreign entity. Such knowledge \nmay come from free availability of the product to Indian \nconsumers or extensive advertising, which reaches a \nsubstantial segment of Indian consumers because of extensive \ncirculation of those advertisements in India. \n \n84.  \nAfter going through the pleading and rival contention \nof the parties. We have observed that even assuming the \napplicant's trademark acquired reputation in foreign countries, \nwhere their trade mark is registered, but no presumption can be \ndrawn at this juncture that trade mark of the applicant \nregistered in foreign countries has automatically acquired \nreputation in India or trans-border reputation is percolated in \nIndia, as we have already pointed out that no document of the \napplicant shows of its extensive usage of the mark in India or \nany other place of registration. \n \n85.  \nThe applicant has failed to establish that indeed the \napplicant has trans-border reputation due to its long and \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

The applicant has \nfurther failed to establish that the trademark “Hypnos” has \nattained the reputation and goodwill which has spilled over in to \nother countries and India. The substantial segments of consumers \nin India know about the existence of the mark „Hypnos‟ as of the \nforeign entity. \n \n86.  \nIt is well settled proposition that the onus is on the \napplicant applying rectification to establish by letting his \nevidence about the trans-border reputation, so the burden is on \nthe applicant herein, the applicant has to discharge his burden \nby showing extensive use and making out strong ground for \nrectification.

In the present case, the petitioner company has failed to \nplace on record a single invoice to show that it has sold any car under the \nbrand „ALPHARD‟ in India. In fact, the trade mark application filed on \nbehalf of the petitioner company in November, 2017 was on a „proposed to \nbe used basis‟. It is petitioner company‟s own case that the same model of \nthe car has been launched in India under a different brand name, „Vellfire‟.  \n15. \nIt is also an admitted position that the petitioner company has not \nadvertised the said brand in India in any manner. Various documents placed \non record by the petitioner company such as, international brochures/annual \nreports, awards, worldwide trade mark registration certificates/renewal \ncertificates and promotional material, are in relation to international usage of \nthe aforesaid trade mark. Undoubtedly, these documents show that the trade \nmark „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and reputation in several other \njurisdictions around the world. However, as per the „territoriality principle‟, \nthe onus is on the petitioner company to show that the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟ had acquired sufficient goodwill and reputation in the Indian \nmarket also. None of the aforesaid documents filed by the petitioner \ncompany shows that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and \nreputation in India. The documents filed by the petitioner company relating \nto India are screenshots from third-party websites showing that a few cars of \nthe petitioner company under the brand „ALPHARD‟ have been listed for \nsale in India. As per the import-export data of India filed on behalf of the \npetitioner company, only fifteen import shipment records have been found \nunder the brand „ALPHARD‟ between the years 2014 to 2016 and not all of \nthem are in respect of vehicles. It may be noted that the aforesaid imports \nhave not been made by the petitioner company itself but by private parties.  \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

However, most of these articles are after the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟ had already been registered by the respondent no.1 in India. It \nis also to be noted that the vehicle under the brand „ALPHARD‟ was never \nlaunched in India. The same model was launched in India in February, 2020 \nunder the brand „Vellfire‟. Therefore, no reliance can be placed on these \narticles to show that the brand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired goodwill and \nreputation in India.  \n17. \nIn Toyota (supra), the „Prius‟ model had been introduced by Toyota in \nthe Indian market in 2009-2010 and there were advertisements in \nautomobile magazines. Despite this, taking note of limited sales of the \nproduct in India and the absence of any advertisement of the product in India \nprior to 2001, the Supreme Court held that the trade mark „Prius‟ cannot be \nsaid to have acquired goodwill and reputation in the Indian market. The \npresent case stands on a worse footing for the petitioner company, as in the \npresent case the petitioner company has neither launched the model under \nthe trade mark „ALPHARD‟ in India nor has advertised the same.  \n18. \nCounsel for the petitioner company has placed reliance on the \njudgments in MAC Personal Care (supra) and Keller Williams Realty \n(supra) in support of his submission that the transborder reputation in respect \nof a trade mark may have a spillover reputation in India as well, despite the \naforesaid brand not having a commercial use in India. In MAC Personal \nCare (supra), the Division Bench enlisted the principles for determining \ninternational reputation.

These principles were \nlaid down by the Supreme Court subsequently in Toyota (supra). Both the \naforesaid judgments were in the context of passing off action and not in the \ncontext of rectification petitions. To be noted that in Keller Williams Realty \n(supra), the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court denied the relief of interim \ninjunction in a passing off action. One of the reasons for denial of interim \ninjunction was that the plaintiff therein had been unable to show spillover of \nits reputation and goodwill in India. Therefore, the reliance placed by the \npetitioner company on the aforesaid judgments is misplaced.  \n19. \nAs regards the contention of the petitioner company that the adoption \nof the mark „ALPHARD‟ by the respondent no.1 is mala fide, counsel for \nthe respondent no.1 has drawn the attention of the Court to the dictionary \nmeaning of the word „Alphard‟1.  The word „Alphard‟ has been described in \nthe following manner: \n“an orange star of the second magnitude that is the brightest star \nin the constellation Hydra \nHydra is actually the largest constellation. Despite its size, it has \nonly one bright star named Alphard. It can be found over in the \nsouthwest sky all by itself—hence the name, which in Arabic \nmeans \"the solitary one.” \n \n20. \nExcept for making a bald averment, the petitioner company has failed \nto place any material on record to show that the adoption by the respondent \nno.1 was mala fide. Therefore, on the basis of evidence on record, it cannot \nbe held that the adoption of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟ by the respondent \nno.1 was mala fide or in bad faith. \n                                          \n1 Alphard. 2023.

To \nappreciate this submission, a reference may be made to the relevant \nprovisions of Section 11 of the Act, which is set out as under: \n“11. Relative grounds for refusal of registration.— (1) Save as \nprovided in section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, \nbecause of— \n \n(a) \n its identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of \ngoods or services covered by the trade mark; or \n \n(b)  \nits similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or \nsimilarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark,  \n \nthere exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, \nwhich includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade \nmark. \n \n(2)  \nA trade mark which— \n \n(a)  \nis identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and \n \n(b)  \nis to be registered for goods or services which are not \nsimilar to those for which the earlier trade mark is registered in \nthe name of a different proprietor,  \n \nshall not be registered, if or to the extent, the earlier trade mark \nis a well-known trade mark in India and the use of the later mark \nwithout due cause would take unfair advantage of or be \ndetrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the earlier \ntrade mark. \n \n(3)  \nA trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\n2023/DHC/000780 \n \nC.O.

Even the ground of passing off under sub-Section (3) \nof Section 11 of the Act would not be available to the petitioner company as \nit has failed to make out a case of having goodwill and reputation in India in \nrespect of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  \n23. \nCounsel for the petitioner company contends that the respondent no.1 \nhas failed to provide any evidence in respect of its use of the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟. The various invoices filed by respondent no.1 to show the \nuser of the aforesaid trade mark is by another entity, „Tekstar Global Private \nLimited‟. In this regard, it may be noted that in the present case, registration \nhas been obtained by the respondent no.1 on a „proposed to be used basis‟, \nwhich is permissible under Section 18 of the Act. Therefore, user on the date \nof registration would not be a relevant factor. The respondent no.1 has \nplaced on record various photographs of its products bearing the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟ as also invoices of its sister company, „Tekstar Global Private \nLimited‟ from 12th May, 2015 to 1st June, 2018 showing sales of products \nunder the trade mark „ALPHARD‟. Therefore, based on the material on \nrecord, it cannot be established that the respondent no.1 has registered the \ntrade mark without any bona fide intention to use the same.  \n24. \nIn view of the above, the petitioner company has completely failed to \ndischarge the onus to show the reputation and goodwill of the mark \n„ALPHARD‟ in India. In fact, it is not even the case of the petitioner \ncompany that it is dealing in products under Class 9 and Class 27 anywhere \nin the world. The documents placed on record by the petitioner company do \nnot reflect extensive use of the brand „ALPHARD‟ or establish that the \nbrand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired a transborder reputation in India in Classes \n9, 12 and 27.

      "summary": "According to the PDF document \"7A Toyota vs Tech Square.pdf\", the case involves a trademark dispute between Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha (Toyota) and Tech Square. The lawsuit, C.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 298/2022, was filed in the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi. The judgment was reserved on January 13, 2023, and delivered on February 3, 2023.\n\nThe case centers on the trademark \"ALPHARD\", which Toyota claims to have adopted in 1986 and used globally, including in India through direct imports. Toyota applied for registration of the trademark in India on November 21, 2017, but was objected to by the Registry. Meanwhile, Tech Square had obtained registration of the same trademark under Classes 9, 12, and 27 on November 5, 2015.\n\nToyota argues that Tech Square's adoption of the trademark was done in a mala fide manner to trade upon Toyota's goodwill and reputation. In contrast, Tech Square claims to be the prior user and bona fide adopter of the trademark since 2015. The court is tasked with deciding the validity of the trademark registrations and resolving the dispute between the parties.\n\nKey facts include Toyota's global sales of over 8,50,000 units under the \"ALPHARD\" trademark since 2002 and its extensive advertising and promotional expenses. The PDF document provides further details on the case, including the legal proceedings, arguments, and decisions. (Source: \"7A Toyota vs Tech Square.pdf\", Page 1-5 of 19)",

It was the case of Toyota that the \ncar under the brand „Prius‟ was launched in Japan in 1997 and in other \ncountries in 2000-2001. However, „Prius‟ was released in India in the year \n2009 and formally launched in the year 2010. The respondent (defendant in \nthe suit), had got the mark „Prius‟ registered in India in 2002 in respect of \nauto parts and accessories and was using the said mark in India since 2001. \nA suit for infringement of the mark „Prius‟ and passing off was filed by \nToyota against the respondent. After a full trial, a Single Judge of this Court \nheld that the acts of the respondent amounted to passing off of the \nrespondent‟s goods under the trade name „Prius‟ and consequently granted a \npermanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff. In appeal, the Division \nBench reversed the judgment of the Single Judge and declined the relief of \npermanent injunction. This was challenged by Toyota before the Supreme \nCourt.  \n10. \nRelying upon the judgments of the Courts in the U.K. and Australia \nand the passages from the book „The Law of Passing-Off‟ by Prof. \nChristopher Wadlow, the Supreme Court applied the „territoriality \nprinciple‟ and held that the transnational reputation of Toyota in respect of \nthe trade mark 'Prius‟ has not spilled over to India and hence, did not grant \npermanent injunction in favour of Toyota. The relevant observations of the \nSupreme Court with regard to the application of the „territoriality principle‟ \nare set out below: \n“32.  \nProf. Cristopher Wadlow's view on the subject appears to \nbe that the test of whether a foreign claimant may succeed in a \npassing-off action is whether his business has a goodwill in a \nparticular jurisdiction, which criterion is broader than the \n“obsolete” test of whether a claimant has a business/place of \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:03.02.2023 18:01:20\nSignature Not Verified",

      "summary": "According to the PDF document \"7A Toyota vs Tech Square.pdf\", the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi delivered a judgment on February 3, 2023, in the case of Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha vs Tech Square Engineered Products. The court dismissed the petition filed by Toyota, which sought rectification of the trade mark \"ALPHARD\" registered in Classes 9, 12, and 27 in favor of Tech Square.\n\nThe court found that Toyota failed to establish its reputation and goodwill in India regarding the trade mark \"ALPHARD\". The petitioner company did not provide sufficient evidence to show extensive use of the brand \"ALPHARD\" in India or worldwide. The documents presented by Toyota reflected limited sales and use of the product in the Indian market, primarily by private parties.\n\nThe respondent, Tech Square, had registered the trade mark \"ALPHARD\" on a \"proposed to be used basis\" under Section 18 of the Act, which is permissible. The court noted that Tech Square had placed on record various photographs of its products bearing the trade mark \"ALPHARD\" and invoices showing sales of products under the mark from 2015 to 2018.\n\nThe court concluded that Toyota had failed to discharge the onus to show the reputation and goodwill of the mark \"ALPHARD\" in India. The petition was dismissed, and the court found no merit in the rectification petitions filed by Toyota.

          "summary": "According to page 18 of the PDF \"7A Toyota vs Tech Square.pdf\", the court ruled that Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha (the petitioner) failed to establish goodwill and reputation in India for the trade mark \"ALPHARD\". The respondent, Tech Square, had registered the trade mark on a \"proposed to be used basis\" under Section 18 of the Act, making user on the date of registration irrelevant. The respondent provided evidence of use, including invoices and photographs of products bearing the trade mark \"ALPHARD\". The court decided that the petitioner failed to discharge the onus to show reputation and goodwill of the mark \"ALPHARD\" in India, with limited sales and use of the brand.

Even the ground of passing off under sub-Section (3) \nof Section 11 of the Act would not be available to the petitioner company as \nit has failed to make out a case of having goodwill and reputation in India in \nrespect of the trade mark „ALPHARD‟.  \n23. \nCounsel for the petitioner company contends that the respondent no.1 \nhas failed to provide any evidence in respect of its use of the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟. The various invoices filed by respondent no.1 to show the \nuser of the aforesaid trade mark is by another entity, „Tekstar Global Private \nLimited‟. In this regard, it may be noted that in the present case, registration \nhas been obtained by the respondent no.1 on a „proposed to be used basis‟, \nwhich is permissible under Section 18 of the Act. Therefore, user on the date \nof registration would not be a relevant factor. The respondent no.1 has \nplaced on record various photographs of its products bearing the trade mark \n„ALPHARD‟ as also invoices of its sister company, „Tekstar Global Private \nLimited‟ from 12th May, 2015 to 1st June, 2018 showing sales of products \nunder the trade mark „ALPHARD‟. Therefore, based on the material on \nrecord, it cannot be established that the respondent no.1 has registered the \ntrade mark without any bona fide intention to use the same.  \n24. \nIn view of the above, the petitioner company has completely failed to \ndischarge the onus to show the reputation and goodwill of the mark \n„ALPHARD‟ in India. In fact, it is not even the case of the petitioner \ncompany that it is dealing in products under Class 9 and Class 27 anywhere \nin the world. The documents placed on record by the petitioner company do \nnot reflect extensive use of the brand „ALPHARD‟ or establish that the \nbrand „ALPHARD‟ has acquired a transborder reputation in India in Classes \n9, 12 and 27.

          "summary": "According to page 19 of the PDF \"7A Toyota vs Tech Square.pdf\", the court ruled in favor of the respondent. The petitioner, Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha, failed to prove that their brand \"ALPHARD\" is well-known in the Indian market. The court stated that no advertisements were made by the petitioner company in India, and a substantial number of consumers are unaware of the brand's existence. \n\nThe judgment was delivered by Amit Bansal, J. on February 3, 2023, after being reserved on January 13, 2023.
