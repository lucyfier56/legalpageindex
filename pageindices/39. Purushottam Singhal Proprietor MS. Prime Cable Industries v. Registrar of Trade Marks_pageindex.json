    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: Purushottam Singhal Proprietor MS. Prime Cable Industries vs. Registrar of Trade Marks & Anr.**\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe appellant, Purushottam Singhal, filed an application for registration of the trade mark \"PRIME CAB\" in Class 9 of the NICE classification on November 20, 1997. The application was pending for several years, with various proceedings taking place, including a First Examination Report (FER) issued on June 29, 2001, and a reply filed by the appellant on September 5, 2001. An opposition to the application was filed by Respondent 2 on July 14, 2006.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the appellant was properly served with notice of the opposition filed by Respondent 2, as required by Section 21(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Section 21(2) states that if the applicant does not respond to the notice of opposition within two months, the application shall be deemed to have been abandoned.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\nThe appellant's counsel, Mr. Akash Swami, argued that the appellant was never served with notice of the opposition filed by Respondent 2. The respondent's counsel, Ms. Shreya Mehra, claimed that notice of the opposition was sent to the appellant's agent, M/s Manmohan Singh and Associates, by speed post on March 18, 2019. However, Ms. Mehra was unable to provide any documentary evidence, such as a postal receipt, to prove that the notice was sent or delivered to the appellant.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nThe court found that the respondent's claim of sending the notice by speed post was not supported by any documentary evidence. The court noted that a bald assertion by the respondent's counsel was not enough to prove that the notice was sent or delivered to the appellant. The court also observed that the respondent had no documentary material evidencing proof of despatch of the notice of hearing of the opposition to the appellant at any point in time.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe court allowed the appeal, setting aside the order of the Registrar of Trade Marks, which had deemed the appellant's application to have been abandoned due to non-response to the notice of opposition. The court held that the respondent had failed to prove that the notice of opposition was properly served on the appellant, and therefore, the application could not be deemed to have been abandoned. The court's decision is based on the lack of evidence to support the respondent's claim of sending the notice by speed post, and the appellant's claim that they never received any such notice.",

First Examination Report \n(FER) was issued on or on behalf of the Registrar on 29th June 2001, to \nwhich the appellant filed his reply on 5th\n \n September 2001. \n3. \nVarious other proceedings took place with respect to the said \napplication, including proceedings which travelled to this Court, which \nare not of particular relevance to the dispute at hand. \n \n4. \nFor the purpose of the present dispute, suffice it to state that an \nopposition was filed by Respondent 2, to the application of the appellant, \non 14th\n \n July 2006. \n5. \nThe appellant’s case is that neither was the appellant, nor was any \nof its authorised agents, ever served with notice of the opposition filed by \nRespondent 2, as required by Section 21(2) of the Trade Marks Act.  \n \n6. \nMs. Shreya Mehra, learned Counsel who appears for Respondent 1 \n(the Registry of Trade Marks) submits that notice of the opposition filed \nby Respondent 2 was sent to M/s Manmohan Singh and Associates, the \nagent of the appellant, by speed post on 18th\n \n March 2019. Mr. Akash \nSwami, learned Counsel for the appellant submits, on instructions, that \nhis client never received any such speed post.  \n7. \nApart from making a statement to the effect that the notice was \nsent by speed post, Ms. Mehra is unable to provide any document \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:21.03.2023\n12:50:28\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023:DHC:1993 \n C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 13/2021                                                                                              Page 3 of 8  \n \n   \ncontaining any postal receipt of the notice of opposition having been sent \nby speed post or of the speed post having been delivered to any addressee \nmentioned therein. All that this Court has, therefore, is a bald assertion, \ncontained in a note handed over by Ms. Mehra to the effect that the \nnotice of opposition was sent to the agent of the appellant by speed post \non 18th\n \n March 2019.  Ms Mehra offers to say so on affidavit; but, in the \nabsence of any proof of the document having in fact been despatched to \nthe appellant by speed post, I cannot, quite obviously, accept the said \nstatement, even if stated on affidavit.  Ms Mehra is candid in admitting \nthat her client has no documentary material evidencing proof of despatch, \nto the appellant, of the notice of hearing of the opposition, at any point of \ntime. \n8. \nMr. Ghorai, who appears on behalf of the Respondent 2, submits \nthat, in fact, there was an earlier service of the notice of opposition on the \nappellant vide letter dated 22nd\n \n October 2008. He has filed a reply to the \npresent petition, placing a copy of the said letter on record.  \n9. \nHowever, a perusal of the letter dated 22nd October 2008 reveals \nthat, while it is addressed to the appellant as well as its agent, the copy \nhas been forwarded only to M/s R K Diwan and Co., as is manifest from \nthe tick mark alongside the name of M/s R K Diwan and Co. There is \nnothing to indicate that the said notice dated 22nd\n \n October 2008 was ever \nserved on the appellant or on any of its authorised agents, or even \ndespatched to any of them. \n10. \nAt this juncture, Mr. Ghorai again intercedes to draw my attention \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:21.03.2023\n12:50:28\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023:DHC:1993 \n C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 13/2021                                                                                              Page 4 of 8  \n \n   \nto a letter dated 30th\n \n“We submit that the Notice of Opposition filed by us on July 14, 2006, \nwas served on the Applicants’ Attorneys under the cover of your letter \nNo. TOP/3224 dated 22nd October 2008.” \n \n March 2013, addressed by M/s R K Diwan and \nCompany to the Registrar of Trade Marks, para 1 of which reads thus: \n11. \nI fail to understand as to how the authorised agent of Respondent 2 \ncould arrogate to itself the authority to certify service of notice of \nopposition on the appellant. To reiterate, there is no document to show \nthat the notice dated 22nd\n \n October 2008 was ever served on the appellant \nor on its authorised agent. \n12. \nIndeed, if, in fact, notice of the opposition had been served on the \nappellant or its authorised agent on 22nd October 2008, there is no \nreasonable expression as to why notice of the opposition was again sent \nto the appellant on 18th March 2019. The fact that the Registry deemed it \nappropriate to issue notice of the opposition to the appellant on 18th \nMarch 2019 also indicates, prima facie, that there was no prior valid \nservice of the notice of opposition on the appellant. I have, in fact, \nqueried of Ms. Mehra, as to whether there was any prior service of notice \non the opposition filed by Respondent 2 on the appellant prior to 18th\n \n \nMarch 2019. She frankly submits that she is unaware of any such service. \n13. \nThe right to seek registration of a trademark is a valid and valuable \nright which vests in an applicant by the Trade Marks Act. Though there \nis no law which mandates registration of a trade mark, a mark, once \nregistered, becomes entitled to valuable privileges under the Act, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:21.03.2023\n12:50:28\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023:DHC:1993 \n C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 13/2021                                                                                              Page 5 of 8  \n \n   \nincluding, most importantly, a right to combat infringement, conferred by \nSection 29.  \n \n14. \nOnce an applicant applies for registration of a trademark, there is \nno reason why the applicant should abandon the application. It is well-\nsettled, in law, that abandonment is necessarily a voluntary act, and \ncannot be presumed, save and except in the manner in which the law \nentitles such a presumption to be drawn. Insofar as the Trade Marks Act \nis concerned, no doubt, Section 21(2) deems an applicant, who has \napplied for registration of a trade mark, to have abandoned the \napplication, if he fails to send, to the Registrar, a counterstatement in \nresponse to the notice of opposition, by any opponent opposing the \napplication, within two months from the date of receipt, by him, of such \nnotice of opposition. In view of the severe consequence of the inaction \nenvisaged by Section 21(2) of the Trade Marks Act, the provision has to \nbe strictly construed. There must, therefore, be positive evidence of (i) \nservice of notice on the applicant, seeking registration of a trade mark, of \nthe copy of the notice of opposition and (ii) failure, by the applicant, to \nsend a counterstatement, in response to the opposition, within two \nmonths therefrom. \n \n15. \nRule 14 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2017 deals with service of \ndocuments, and sub-rules (1) to (3) thereof read thus: \n“14. \nService of documents. –  \n \n(1) \nAll applications, notices, statements, papers having \nrepresentations affixed thereto, or other documents authorised \nor required by the Act or the rules made thereunder, served, \nleft or sent, at or to the Trade Marks Registry or with or to the \nRegistrar or any other person may be delivered by hand or sent \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:21.03.2023\n12:50:28\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023:DHC:1993 \n C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 13/2021                                                                                              Page 6 of 8  \n \n   \nthrough the post by a prepaid letter or may be submitted \nelectronically in the manner as laid down by the Registry. \n \n(2) \nAn application or any document so sent shall be \ndeemed to have been made, served, left or sent at the time \nwhen the letter containing the same would be delivered in the \nordinary course of post. \n \n(3) \nIn proving such sending, it shall be sufficient to prove \nthat the letter was properly addressed and put into the post.” \n \n16. \nShorn of superfluities, Rule 14(1) envisages delivery, of all \napplications, notices, statements, papers or other documents, “by hand or \nsent through the post by a pre-paid letter” or electronically in the manner \nlaid down by the Registrar. \n \n17. \nIn the present case, though the appellant was situated in Delhi, \nthere is no proof of any effort having been made to serve the notice of \nopposition dated 14th\n \n July 2006, filed by Respondent 2 on the appellant \nby hand. Nor does Ms. Mehra so assert. \n18. \nNor is it Ms. Mehra’s case that there was any electronic service of \nthe notice of opposition on the appellant. \n \n19. \nService through post, under Rule 14(1), has to be by a pre-paid \nletter. I have already noted that, save and except for an averment \ncontained in the note that Ms. Mehra has handed over across the Bar \ntoday, there is no proof of any postal service of the notice of the \nopposition dated 14th\n \n July 2006 filed by Respondent 2 having been \neffected on the appellant. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:21.03.2023\n12:50:28\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023:DHC:1993 \n C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 13/2021                                                                                              Page 7 of 8  \n \n   \n20. \nMr. Ghorai also places reliance on Rule 17(3)2\n \n of the Trade Marks \nRules. I am completely baffled as to how the said rule can be at of any \napplication whatsoever in the present case. On its plain reading, Rule \n17(3) applies only where no address for service in India is given as \nrequired by Section 17(1). The address for service of the appellant, as \ngiven in the plaintiff’s application, was not only in India but was in \nDelhi. There was, therefore, no legitimate reason as to why, in fact, \nnotice of the opposition was not served on the appellant by hand, which \nwas the first method of service envisaged by Rule 14(1) of the Trade \nMarks Rules. \n21. \nIn the present case, there being no proof of any service of the \nnotice of opposition of dated 14th\n \n July 2006 of Respondent 2 having been \neffected on the appellant in the manner envisaged by the Trade Marks \nRules, the invocation, by the impugned order of Section 21(2) of the \nTrade Marks Act must be held to be misguided. \n22. \nI am informed that the notice of opposition dated 14th\n                                          \n2 17.  \nAddress for service. –  \n(1)  \nEvery applicant or opponent or any person concerned in any proceeding under the Act or rules \nshall furnish to the Registrar an address for service in India comprising of a postal address in India and a \nvalid e-mail address and such address shall be treated as the address for service of such applicant or \nopponent or person: \nProvided that a trade mark agent shall also be required to furnish a mobile number registered \nin India. \n(2)  \nAny written communication addressed to a person as aforesaid at an address for service in \nIndia given by him shall be deemed to be properly addressed. \n(3)  \nUnless an address for service in India as required in sub-rule (1) is given, the Registrar shall \nbe under no obligation to send any notice that may be required by the Act or the rules and no subsequent \norder or decision in the proceedings shall be called in question on the ground of any lack or non-service \nof notice. \n \n July 2006 is \navailable on the website of the Registrar of Trade Marks.

There was, therefore, no legitimate reason as to why, in fact, \nnotice of the opposition was not served on the appellant by hand, which \nwas the first method of service envisaged by Rule 14(1) of the Trade \nMarks Rules. \n21. \nIn the present case, there being no proof of any service of the \nnotice of opposition of dated 14th\n \n July 2006 of Respondent 2 having been \neffected on the appellant in the manner envisaged by the Trade Marks \nRules, the invocation, by the impugned order of Section 21(2) of the \nTrade Marks Act must be held to be misguided. \n22. \nI am informed that the notice of opposition dated 14th\n                                          \n2 17.  \nAddress for service. –  \n(1)  \nEvery applicant or opponent or any person concerned in any proceeding under the Act or rules \nshall furnish to the Registrar an address for service in India comprising of a postal address in India and a \nvalid e-mail address and such address shall be treated as the address for service of such applicant or \nopponent or person: \nProvided that a trade mark agent shall also be required to furnish a mobile number registered \nin India. \n(2)  \nAny written communication addressed to a person as aforesaid at an address for service in \nIndia given by him shall be deemed to be properly addressed. \n(3)  \nUnless an address for service in India as required in sub-rule (1) is given, the Registrar shall \nbe under no obligation to send any notice that may be required by the Act or the rules and no subsequent \norder or decision in the proceedings shall be called in question on the ground of any lack or non-service \nof notice. \n \n July 2006 is \navailable on the website of the Registrar of Trade Marks.
