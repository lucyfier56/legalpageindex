    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: Bennet, Coleman and Company Limited vs. VNOW Technologies Private Limited and Anr.**\n\n**Background:**\nThe case involves a rectification petition filed by Bennet, Coleman and Company Limited (the \"Plaintiff\") against VNOW Technologies Private Limited (the \"Defendant\") under Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The petition seeks to remove the trade mark \"VNOW\" from the register of trade marks in respect of certain services.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe main issue in the case is whether the registration of the trade mark \"VNOW\" by the Defendant is liable to be rectified on the grounds that it is similar to the Plaintiff's registered trade marks, including \"TIMES NOW\", \"ET NOW\", and \"MOVIES NOW\". The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant's mark is likely to cause confusion among the public and dilute the distinctiveness of the Plaintiff's marks.\n\n**Arguments:**\nThe Plaintiff's counsel, Ms. Mamta Rani Jha, argued that the Defendant's mark \"VNOW\" is deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's marks, particularly \"TIMES NOW\", and that the services covered by the Defendant's mark, including transmission, reception, and sharing of digital data and content, are similar to the services covered by the Plaintiff's marks. The Plaintiff also pointed out that the Defendant had failed to respond to the notice issued by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) and had remained continuously absent throughout the proceedings.\n\n**Court Findings:**\nThe court heard the Plaintiff's counsel and perused the record, noting that the Defendant had failed to respond to the notice and had remained absent throughout the proceedings. The court found that the Plaintiff had made out a prima facie case for rectification of the register of trade marks and that the Defendant's mark \"VNOW\" was likely to cause confusion among the public.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court allowed the rectification petition and ordered the removal of the trade mark \"VNOW\" from the register of trade marks in respect of the services covered by the Defendant's mark. The court held that the registration of the Defendant's mark was liable to be rectified under Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and that the Plaintiff had successfully established its case for rectification.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. The court's decision highlights the importance of responding to notices and participating in proceedings to avoid adverse orders.\n2. The case demonstrates the application of Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, in rectifying the register of trade marks to prevent confusion among the public.\n3. The decision emphasizes the need for distinctiveness and non-similarity between trade marks to avoid dilution of brand identity.\n\nOverall, the case provides guidance on trade mark law and the importance of protecting intellectual property rights in India.",

Times Now, as is well-known, is a news channel which \nattracts considerable viewership and is viewed both within and outside \nthe country.  Following the success of Times Now, the petitioner \nlaunched a business news channel under the mark „ET Now‟ in June \n2009.  Closely following thereupon, „Movies Now‟ as a television \nchannel featuring Hollywood films, was launched by the petitioner in \n2010, „Romedy Now‟, a television showing romantic and comedy \nHollywood films was launched in September 2013 and „Magic Bricks \nNow‟, a television channel providing information with respect to real \nestate and property was launched on 31st October 2015.   Magic Bricks \nNow was renamed Mirror Now in 2017. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 117/2021  \nPage 5 of 19 \n \n6. \nThe petitioner felicitously refers to the aforesaid marks „TIMES \nNOW‟, „ET NOW‟, „MOVIES NOW‟, „MIRROR NOW‟ and \n„ROMEDY NOW‟ as “the NOW centric trade marks”.  By dint of \ncontinuous usage as well as the rights that accrue in favour of the \npetitioner consequent to the aforesaid registrations held by it, the \npetitioner asserts that it has exclusive rights to use the expression \n„NOW‟ as any part of a trade mark in respect of services relatable to \nClass 38.  The petition also avers that, owing to the reputation that the \npetitioner‟s services have garnered over time, the afore-noted \nregistered trademarks of the petitioner are entitled to be regarded as \n„well-known trade marks‟ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(zg)2 of \nthe Trade Marks Act.  \n \n7. \nThe mark \n stands registered by the Registrar of Trade \nMarks in favour of Respondent 1 in Class 38, covering “transmission, \nreception & sharing of downloadable digital data & content, electronic \ncommunication services, providing access to GPS/lbs/other navigation \nservices, access to  electronic communication network, web \ncasting/online/ offline services for transmission or reception of \naudio/video/data files & content, multimedia, access to internet/web \nservices/tv/telecommunication \nservices \nvia \ntelecommunication \nequipment or smart phones or mobile phones or wearable devices or \nsmart \nwatches \nor \nwatches \nor \nwireless \n(2g/3g/4g/5g/7g/WIFI/WIMAX/VSAT) enabled devices or GPS/ GPRS \nenabled device, Bluetooth enabled devices, tablet computer or smart \n                                          \n2 2.   \nDefinitions and interpretation. –   \n(1) \nIn this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, – \n(zg)  \n“well-known trade mark”, in relation to any goods or services, means a mark \nwhich has become so to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or \nreceives such services that the use of such mark in relation to other goods or services \nwould be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course of trade or rendering \nof services between those goods or services and a person during the mark in relation to \nthe first-mentioned goods or services. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

Ergo this petition, seeking rectification \nof the Trade Marks register by restricting the registration of the \n \nmark, in the respondent‟s favour, to “smart security solution devices, \npower bank, chats or social networking services or conferences or \nwebinars” and deleting, therefrom, all other services covered by the \nregistration as it stands today.  For the sake of convenience and \nnothing else, I would allude to the services of which the petitioner \nseeks evisceration from the respondent‟s registration, as “the \nimpugned services”.  \n \n9. \nThe use, in the impugned \n mark, of „NOW‟, according to \nthe petitioner, would lead to confusion in the minds of the public, in \nview of the registration held by the petitioner in respect of its „NOW‟-\ncentric trademarks.  „NOW‟, submits Ms Mamta Rani Jha arguing for \nthe petitioner, is an essential and dominant feature of the impugned \n mark, just as it is a dominant feature of the „NOW‟-centric \ntrademarks of the petitioner.  Inasmuch as the services provided by the \nrespondent under the impugned \n mark are largely identical to \nthe services provided by the petitioner under its registered marks, Ms \nJha asserts that a viewer, possessed of average intelligence and \nimperfect recollection, who views the channel of the respondent under \nthe impugned \n mark, would be inclined to regard the services \nprovided by the petitioner as coming from, or at least having an \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

She, therefore, contends that the \nimpugned mark \n, to the extent it includes, within its ambit, \nservices which are covered by the petitioner‟s „NOW‟-centric marks,  \ninfracts (1), (2), (3)(a) and (10) of Section 113 read with Section 29 of \nthe Trade Marks Act is non-registrable and that its continuance on the \nRegister of Trade Marks in its present form is, therefore, violative of \nthe law.  Resultantly, the petitioner seeks rectification of the register \nby deleting, therefrom, the impugned services.   \n \n10. \nHaving heard Ms. Mamta Rani Jha, learned Counsel for the \npetitioner, and perused the record, it is apparent, from the record, that \nthe petitioner has registrations, in its favour, of several marks which \ninvolve „NOW‟ as the latter part of the mark, under class 38.  The \nsubmission of Ms. Mamta Rani Jha is that, in the circumstances, an \nunwary viewer who views the defendant‟s channel, which provides \nidentical services under the impugned \n mark, would be \ninclined to draw an association between the impugned mark and the \n                                          \n3 11.  \nRelative grounds for refusal of registration. –  \n(1)  \nSave as provided in Section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, because of –  \n(a)  \nits identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services \ncovered by the trade mark; or \n(b)  \nits similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods \nor services covered by the trade mark, \nthere exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of \nassociation with the earlier trade mark. \n(2)  \nA trade mark which –  \n(a)  \nis identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and \n(b) \nis to be registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which \nthe earlier trade mark is registered in the name of a different proprietor, \nshall not be registered if or to the extent the earlier trade mark is a well-known trade mark in India \nand the use of the later mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to \nthe distinctive character or repute of the earlier trade mark. \n(3)  \nA trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in India is liable to be \nprevented –  \n(a)  \nby virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off protecting an \nunregistered trade mark used in the course of trade; or \n(b)  \nby virtue of law of copyright. \n***** \n \n(10)  \nWhile considering an application for registration of a trade mark and opposition filed in \nrespect thereof, the Registrar shall –  \n(i)   \nprotect a well-known trade mark against the identical or similar trade marks; \n(ii)  \ntake into consideration the bad faith involved either of the applicant or the \nopponent affecting the right relating to the trade mark. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

Shree Vardhman Rice & General \nMills4, which has been followed by another Division Bench in \nKirorimal Kashiram Marketing  v. Shree Sita Chawal Udyog Mill5. \nOne may usefully reproduce, in this context, para 18 of the report in \nAmar Singh Chawal Wala4: \n“18.  \nIt is not possible to agree with the reasoning of the learned \nSingle Judge that the word QILLA is not associated with rice and \ntherefore no ordinary purchaser of rice would associate the \nDefendant's mark as that of the Plaintiffs. It is plain from the \npleadings that the Plaintiff has been using the words QILLA \nconsistently in connection with the rice being sold by them with \nonly the first word indicating the colour viz., GOLDEN, LAL or \nNEELA. It must be held that the Plaintiff has been able to prima \nfacie show that it has developed a ‘family of marks’ and that by \nmerely changing the first word from GOLDEN, LAL or NEELA to \nthe word HARA there is every possibility of confusion being caused \nboth in trade and in the mind of any person desiring to purchase \nrice. Likewise the use of the picture or depiction of a fort in the \nbackground on the label/packing of the rice is also likely to cause \nconfusion in the mind of the purchaser and in the trade that the \nproduct being sold by the Defendants are in fact those \nmanufactured by the Plaintiff.” \n(Emphasis supplied) \n \nIn a similar vein, the High Court of Bombay, in Neon Laboratories \nLtd v. Themis Medicare Ltd6, held the “XYLOX family of marks” \ncomprising XYLOX 2%, XYLOX HEAVY, XYLOX GEL, XYLOX \nADRENALINE and XYLOX 2% Jelly to be infringing the “LOX \nfamily of marks” comprising LOX 2% ADRENALINE, LOX 4%, \nLOX 5%, LOX HEAVY 5%, LOX VISCOUS, LOXALPRIN, \nLOXALPRY, LOXIMLA, PLOX and RILOX. \n                                          \n4 ILR (2009)VI Delhi 399  \n5 AIR 1963 SC 449 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

I will refer to the \nregistered trade marks of the plaintiff, therefore, as “the „NOW‟ \nfamily of marks” hereinafter, instead of “the „NOW‟-centric marks”. \n \n13. \nSection 17(1)7 clarifies that the proprietorial rights conferred by \nregistration is for the mark as a whole.  In other words, the rights \nconferred on the petitioner by the registrations held by it in respect of \nthe NOW family of marks are over the TIMES NOW, ET NOW, \nROMEDY NOW, MOVIES NOW and MIRROR NOW marks as a \nwhole in each case, and not for the mark „NOW‟ per se.  Section \n17(2)(a)8 makes matters clearer, by disentitling exclusivity in respect \nof part of a mark which is registered as a whole.  This has, over time, \ncome to be known as “the anti-dissection rule”.  \n \n14. \nThe registrations held by the petitioner in the „NOW‟ family of \nmarks confers, therefore, on it, rights to claim exclusivity in respect of \neach of the marks as a whole, and not in respect of the „NOW‟ part of \neach of the marks.   \n \n                                                                                                                   \n6 (2014) 60 PTC 621 \n7 17.  \nEffect of registration of parts of a mark. –  \n(1)  \nWhen a trade mark consists of several matters, its registration shall confer on the \nproprietor exclusive right to the use of the trade mark taken as a whole. \n8 (2)  \nNotwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), when a trade mark –  \n(a)  \ncontains any part –  \n(i)  \nwhich is not the subject of a separate application by the proprietor for \nregistration as a trade mark; or \n(ii)  \nwhich is not separately registered by the proprietor as a trade mark; or \n(b)  \ncontains any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of a non-distinctive \ncharacter, \nthe registration thereof shall not confer any exclusive right in the matter forming only a part of the whole of \nthe trade mark so registered. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 117/2021  \nPage 10 of 19 \n \n15. \nThe anti-dissection rule is, however, subject to a caveat, \nelucidated thus by Pradeep Nandrajog, J. (as he then was), speaking \nfor a Division Bench of this Court, in South India Beverages Pvt Ltd \nv. General Mills Marketing Inc.9: \n“19.  \nThough it bears no reiteration that while a mark is to be \nconsidered in entirety, yet it is permissible to accord more or less \nimportance or „dominance‟ to a particular portion or element of a \nmark in cases of composite marks. Thus, a particular element of a \ncomposite mark which enjoys greater prominence vis-à-vis other \nconstituent elements, may be termed as a „dominant mark‟. \n \n20.  \nAt this juncture it would be apposite to refer to a recent \ndecision of this Court reported as Stiefel Laborataries v. Ajanta \nPharma Ltd10.  The Court whilst expounding upon the principle of \n„anti-dissection‟ cited with approval the views of the eminent \nauthor on the subject comprised in his authoritative treatise-\nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition. It was \nobserved: \n \n“41.  \nThe anti-dissection rule which is under these \ncircumstances required to be applied in India is really based \nupon nature of customer. It has been rightly set out in \nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition about \nthe said rule particularly in Para 23.15 which is reproduced \nhereunder: \n \n23.15 Comparing \nMarks: \nDifferences v. Similarities \n \n[1]  \nThe Anti-Dissection Rule \n \n[a]  \nCompare \ncomposites \nas \na \nWhole \n: \nConflicting composite marks are to be compared by \nlooking at them as a whole, rather than breaking the \nmarks \nup \ninto \ntheir \ncomponent \nparts \nfor \ncomparison. This is the “anti dissection” rule. The \nrationale for the rule is that the commercial \nimpression of a composite trademark on an ordinary \nprospective buyer is created by the mark as a whole, \nnot by its component parts. However, it is not a \nviolation of the anti-dissection rule to view the \ncomponent parts of conflicting composite marks as \na preliminary step on the way to an ultimate \ndetermination of probable customer reaction to the \nconflicting composites as a whole. Thus, conflicting \n                                          \n9 (2015) 61 PTC 231 \n10 211 (2014) DLT 296  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 117/2021  \nPage 11 of 19 \n \nmarks must be compared in their entireties. A mark \nshould not be dissected or split up into its \ncomponent parts and each part then compared with \ncorresponding parts of the conflicting mark to \ndetermine the likelihood of confusion. It is the \nimpression that the mark as a whole creates on the \naverage reasonably prudent buyer and not the parts \nthereof, that is important. As the Supreme Court \nobserved:“The \ncommercial \nimpression \nof \na \ntrademark is derived from it as a whole, not from its \nelements separated and considered in detail. For this \nreason it should be considered in its entirety.” The \nanti-dissection rule is based upon a common sense \nobservation of customer behavior : the typical \nshopper does not retain all of the individual details \nof a composite mark in his or her mind, but retains \nonly an overall, general impression created by the \ncomposite as a whole. It is the overall impression \ncreated by the mark from the ordinary shopper's \ncursory observation in the marketplace that will or \nwill not lead to a likelihood of confusion, not the \nimpression created from a meticulous comparison \nas expressed in carefully weighed analysis in legal \nbriefs. In litigation over the alleged similarity of \nmarks, the owner will emphasize the similarities \nand the alleged infringer will emphasize the \ndifferences. The point is that the two marks should \nnot be examined with a microscope to find the \ndifferences, for this is not the way the average \npurchaser views the marks. To the average buyer, \nthe points of similarity are more important that \nminor points of difference. A court should not \nengage in “technical gymnastics” in an attempt to \nfind some minor differences between conflicting \nmarks. \n \nHowever, where there are both similarities and differences \nin the marks, there must be weighed against one another to \nsee which predominate. \n \nThe rationale of the anti-dissection rule is based upon this \nassumption: “An average purchaser does not retain all the \ndetails of a mark, but rather the mental impression of the \nmark creates in its totality. It has been held to be a violation \nof the anti-dissection rule to focus upon the “prominent” \nfeature of a mark and decide likely confusion solely upon \nthat feature, ignoring all other elements of the mark. \nSimilarly, it is improper to find that one portion of a \ncomposite mark has no trademark significance, leading to a \ndirect comparison between only that which remains.” \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 117/2021  \nPage 12 of 19 \n \n21.  \nThe view of the author makes it scintillatingly clear, \nbeyond pale of doubt, that the principle of „anti dissection‟ does \nnot impose an absolute embargo upon the consideration of the \nconstituent elements of a composite mark. The said elements may \nbe viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate \ndetermination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting \ncomposites as a whole. Thus, the principle of „anti-dissection‟ and \nidentification of „dominant mark‟ are not antithetical to one \nanother and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles \nrather compliment each other. \n \n23.  \nIt is also settled that while a trademark is supposed to be \nlooked at in entirety, yet the consideration of a trademark as a \nwhole does not condone infringement where less than the entire \ntrademark is appropriated. It is therefore not improper to identify \nelements or features of the marks that are more or less important \nfor purpose of analysis in cases of composite marks. \n \n26.  \nDominant features are significant because they attract \nattention and consumers are more likely to remember and rely on \nthem for purposes of identification of the product. Usually, the \ndominant portion of a mark is that which has the greater strength or \ncarries more weight. Descriptive or generic components, having \nlittle or no source identifying significance, are generally less \nsignificant in the analysis. However, words that are arbitrary and \ndistinct possess greater strength and are thus accorded greater \nprotection. [Autozone, Inc. v. Tandy Corporation11]” \n(Emphasis in original) \n \nWhere, therefore, part of a composite mark is dominant, another mark, \nwhich copies or replicates that dominant part, may infringe.  As South \nIndia Beverages9, this caveat does not violate the “anti dissection \nrule” statutorily engrafted in Section 17(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, \nas it merely identifies that part of the whole mark which, being \ndominant, confers, to the whole mark as registered, distinctiveness and \nexclusivity.   \n \n16. \nWhere a family of marks is involved, as in the present case, the \nidentification of the dominant part is greatly simplified.

(COMM.IPD-TM) 117/2021  \nPage 13 of 19 \n \ndominant part of the mark family.  It is but obvious that a viewer who \nviews the TIMES NOW, ET NOW, ROMEDY NOW, MIRROR \nNOW and MOVIES NOW channels would identify NOW as the \ndistinctive common feature of all the marks and, therefore, their \n“dominant” part. \n \n17. \nThe sequitur is obvious.  If such a viewer, endowed with the \nmythical attributes of an average intelligence and an imperfect \nrecollection, were to come across another channel, providing similar \nservices, with a title of which „NOW‟ is the latter part, there is every \nlikelihood of his regarding the channel as part of the petitioner‟s \nrepertoire, or at least as having an association with the NOW-family \nof channels of the petitioner.   \n \n18. \nIt is also important in this context to note the exact features of \nthe impugned mark. Though the defendant had the impugned mark \nregistered as a single word „VNOW‟, the word „VNOW‟ is unknown \nto the English language.  It has no etymological meaning unlike, for \nexample, „KNOW‟ or „SNOW‟.  A person who has to pronounce the \nimpugned mark would, therefore, pronounce it „vee-now‟. The \n„NOW‟ part of the impugned mark would be separately and distinctly \nintoned by any person who seeks to pronounce the impugned mark  \nand, therefore, would have its own distinct identity even if it is not \nused as a separate word, as has been used by the plaintiff in respect of \nits „NOW‟-family of marks.  \n \n19. \nThe usage, by the defendant, of a different colour for the \n„NOW‟ part of the impugned \n  mark further emphasizes its \n                                                                                                                   \n11 174 F.

Thus, even as \nseen visually, „NOW‟ forms a distinct and separately identifiable part \nof the defendant‟s impugned mark.  In that view of the matter, the \nmere fact that the impugned \n mark is written as one word and \nnot as two words would not make any difference to the issue at hand.  \n \n20. \nDo, then, the various sub-sections of Section 11, as invoked by \nMs Jha, apply, to disentitle the impugned \n mark to registration \nunder the Trade Marks Act? \n \n21. \nSection 11(1)(b): \n \n21.1 Section 11(1)(b) proscribes registration of a trade mark which \n(i) is similar to an earlier trade mark and (ii) is used in respect of \ngoods or services which are identical or similar to the earlier mark.  \nWhere these elements coalesce, and (iii) where it is found that, by \nsuch usage, a likelihood of confusion, or a likelihood of association, \nby the public, with the earlier trade mark, exists, the mark cannot be \nregistered.  \n \n21.2 I have already held that the usage of „NOW‟ as the latter part of \nthe impugned \n mark renders the mark similar to the „NOW‟-\nfamily of marks registered in favour of the plaintiff, as „NOW‟ \nconstitutes the dominant part thereof.  Where the dominant parts of \ntwo marks are identical, the marks have necessarily to be regarded as \nsimilar.  The services, of which the petitioner seeks deletion from the \narray of services in respect of which the impugned \n mark stands \nregistered, are identical to the services rendered by the plaintiff, in \nrespect of which the marks in the „NOW‟-family stand registered.  \nThere is, therefore, every likelihood of an unwary member of the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

The \ningredients of Section 11(1)(b), therefore, stand satisfied.  \n \n22. \nSections 11(2) and (3) vis-à-vis Section 11(5)12:   \n \n22.1 Section 11(2) of the Trade Marks Act proscribes registration of \na mark which is identical with, or similar to, an earlier trade mark, \neven if the goods or services, in respect of which its registration is \nsought, are different from those in respect of which the earlier mark \nstands registered, provided (i) the earlier mark is a well known trade \nmark within the meaning of Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trade Marks Act \nand (ii) the use of the later mark without due cause would take unfair \nadvantage of, or be detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute \nof the earlier mark.  Section 11(3) proscribes registration of any trade \nmark if its use in India is liable to be prevented by the law of passing \noff or by the law of copyright.   \n \n22.2 Section 11(5), however, obviates the necessity of examining the \napplicability either of Section 11(2) or of Section 11(3).  Section 11(5) \nclearly holds that a mark would not be refused registration on the \ngrounds specified in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 11 unless an \nobjection, on one of the grounds envisaged by Section 11(2) of \nSection 11(3), is raised in an opposition proceedings by the proprietor \nof the earlier trade mark, i.e., in the present case, the petitioner.  \n \n22.3 It is an undisputed position that no objection relatable to Section \n                                          \n12 (5)  \nA trade mark shall not be refused registration on the grounds specified in sub-sections (2) and (3), \nunless objection on any one or more of those grounds is raised in opposition proceedings by the proprietor of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

I am unable to agree. \n \n22.5 Once a mark is registered, Section 57 confers, on a person \naggrieved by the registration, the right to seek its cancellation and \nconsequent rectification of the register.  The circumstances in which \ncancellation and rectification can be sought are circumscribed within \nsub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 57.  Section 57(1) envisages \ncancellation or variation of the entry in the register where there is any \ncontravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register.  \nThat provision, quite clearly, does not apply to the present case. \n \n22.6 Section 57(2) envisages removal of a mark from the register \nwhere either (i) the entry is made in the register without sufficient \ncause or (ii) the entry is wrongly remaining in the register or (iii) there \nis any error or defect in the entry in the register.  If one or more of \nthese three exigencies exists, the mark can either be expunged or \nvaried from the register.  \n \n22.7 Of these three exigencies, the only exigency which could apply \nin the present case is the second i.e., that the defendant‟s mark is \n                                                                                                                   \nthe earlier trade mark. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 117/2021  \nPage 17 of 19 \n \ncontinuing to wrongly remain in the register. Etymologically, a mark \ncould be regarded as “wrongly remaining on the register” either (i) \nwhere it was correctly registered but, owing to intervening \ncircumstances, its continuance on the register is impermissible, or (ii) \nwhere its very registration was bad, as the mark was non-registerable \non account of one or more of the grounds envisaged in Sections 9 and \n11 of the Trade Marks Act.   I need not concern myself with the first \nof these two exigencies, as Ms Mamta Rani Jha has squarely relied on \nSection 11(1), (2) and (3), which imperil the very entitlement of the \nmark to registration, to canvass her case.  Ms Jha‟s submission is, \ntherefore, that, as the impugned \n mark was not entitled to \nregistration and was, nonetheless, registered, its continuance on the \nregister was impermissible in law; in other words, that it was \n“wrongly remaining on the register”.  \n \n22.8 The entitlement of the impugned mark to registration and the \nentitlement of the opponent of the mark to seek its cancellation or \nvariation, thus, statutorily dovetail into one another.  To be able to \nsuccessfully contend that the respondent‟s \n mark was liable to \nbe cancelled or varied, Ms Jha would have to successfully invoke one \nor more of the sub-sections of Section 9 or Section 11.  All the rigours \nwhich statutorily apply to these provisions, and their invocability, \nwould also, therefore, apply to Ms Jha‟s attempt to do so.    \n \n22.9 I am, therefore, of the considered opinion that Section 11(5) \ndoes not apply differently at the stage when the application for \nregistration of a mark is under consideration and when an application \nfor rectification of the register and removal of a mark therefrom, under \nSection 57(2), has been made.  Section 11(5) operates as a proviso to \nSections 11(2) and 11(3), by excepting their applicability to cases in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

If, therefore, no \nopposition predicated on Section 11(2) or 11(3) was raised by the \npetition when the defendant‟s \n mark was being considered for \nregistration, the mark could not have been refused registration under \nSection 11(2) or 11(3).  The corollary would, therefore, be that the \ngrant of registration to the \n mark cannot be said to be improper, \nillegal or vitiated as being violative of Section 11(2) or 11(3).   \n \n22.10 As, admittedly, no opposition, predicated on Section 11(2) or \n11(3) was raised by the petitioner at the time when the defendant‟s  \n mark was proceeding to registration, the petitioner cannot urge \nSection 11(2) or 11(3) as a ground to seek its cancellation or variation. \n \n23. \nIn any event, as the grant of registration to the impugned mark \nof the defendant has already been found by me to be violative of \nSection 11(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act, a clear case for rectification \nof the register and variation of the impugned mark as sought by the \npetitioner, so as to remove the handicap of Section 11(1)(b), is made \nout.   \n \nConclusion \n \n24. \nResultantly, the Registration No. 2948252 dated 23rd April 2015 \ngranted to the impugned \n mark in favour of the defendant in \nclass 38 shall stand varied and, consequently, rectified by deleting, \nfrom the services in respect of which the impugned mark is registered, \n“Transmission, Reception & Sharing Of Downloadable Digital Data \n& Content, Electronic Communication Services, Providing Access To \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001066 \n C.O.

Shree Sita Chawal Udyog Mill5. \nOne may usefully reproduce, in this context, para 18 of the report in \nAmar Singh Chawal Wala4: \n“18.  \nIt is not possible to agree with the reasoning of the learned \nSingle Judge that the word QILLA is not associated with rice and \ntherefore no ordinary purchaser of rice would associate the \nDefendant's mark as that of the Plaintiffs. It is plain from the \npleadings that the Plaintiff has been using the words QILLA \nconsistently in connection with the rice being sold by them with \nonly the first word indicating the colour viz., GOLDEN, LAL or \nNEELA. It must be held that the Plaintiff has been able to prima \nfacie show that it has developed a ‘family of marks’ and that by \nmerely changing the first word from GOLDEN, LAL or NEELA to \nthe word HARA there is every possibility of confusion being caused \nboth in trade and in the mind of any person desiring to purchase \nrice. Likewise the use of the picture or depiction of a fort in the \nbackground on the label/packing of the rice is also likely to cause \nconfusion in the mind of the purchaser and in the trade that the \nproduct being sold by the Defendants are in fact those \nmanufactured by the Plaintiff.” \n(Emphasis supplied) \n \nIn a similar vein, the High Court of Bombay, in Neon Laboratories \nLtd v. Themis Medicare Ltd6, held the “XYLOX family of marks” \ncomprising XYLOX 2%, XYLOX HEAVY, XYLOX GEL, XYLOX \nADRENALINE and XYLOX 2% Jelly to be infringing the “LOX \nfamily of marks” comprising LOX 2% ADRENALINE, LOX 4%, \nLOX 5%, LOX HEAVY 5%, LOX VISCOUS, LOXALPRIN, \nLOXALPRY, LOXIMLA, PLOX and RILOX. \n                                          \n4 ILR (2009)VI Delhi 399  \n5 AIR 1963 SC 449 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified",

As the Supreme Court \nobserved:“The \ncommercial \nimpression \nof \na \ntrademark is derived from it as a whole, not from its \nelements separated and considered in detail. For this \nreason it should be considered in its entirety.” The \nanti-dissection rule is based upon a common sense \nobservation of customer behavior : the typical \nshopper does not retain all of the individual details \nof a composite mark in his or her mind, but retains \nonly an overall, general impression created by the \ncomposite as a whole. It is the overall impression \ncreated by the mark from the ordinary shopper's \ncursory observation in the marketplace that will or \nwill not lead to a likelihood of confusion, not the \nimpression created from a meticulous comparison \nas expressed in carefully weighed analysis in legal \nbriefs.

It has been held to be a violation \nof the anti-dissection rule to focus upon the “prominent” \nfeature of a mark and decide likely confusion solely upon \nthat feature, ignoring all other elements of the mark. \nSimilarly, it is improper to find that one portion of a \ncomposite mark has no trademark significance, leading to a \ndirect comparison between only that which remains.” \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified",

The judge states that this principle does not prevent the consideration of individual elements of a composite mark. In fact, identifying dominant features of a mark is significant, as they attract attention and help consumers identify a product. The court cites the \"NOW\"-family of marks, where \"NOW\" is the dominant part, as an example. The judge rules that if another mark copies or replicates this dominant part, it may infringe on the original mark. This decision is based on the Trade Marks Act, specifically Section 17(2)(a).

The said elements may \nbe viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate \ndetermination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting \ncomposites as a whole. Thus, the principle of „anti-dissection‟ and \nidentification of „dominant mark‟ are not antithetical to one \nanother and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles \nrather compliment each other. \n \n23.  \nIt is also settled that while a trademark is supposed to be \nlooked at in entirety, yet the consideration of a trademark as a \nwhole does not condone infringement where less than the entire \ntrademark is appropriated. It is therefore not improper to identify \nelements or features of the marks that are more or less important \nfor purpose of analysis in cases of composite marks. \n \n26.  \nDominant features are significant because they attract \nattention and consumers are more likely to remember and rely on \nthem for purposes of identification of the product. Usually, the \ndominant portion of a mark is that which has the greater strength or \ncarries more weight. Descriptive or generic components, having \nlittle or no source identifying significance, are generally less \nsignificant in the analysis.

          "summary": "According to page 16 of the PDF \"Bennet, Coleman and Company v. Vnow Technologies Pvt Ltd.\", the court discusses the applicability of Section 11(2) or 11(3) in opposition proceedings. The petitioner's counsel, Ms. Mamta Rani Jha, argues that Section 11(5) only applies at the time of original registration. However, the court disagrees. \n\nThe court refers to Section 57, which allows a person aggrieved by a registration to seek cancellation and rectification of the register. Section 57(2) enables removal of a mark from the register if the entry is made without sufficient cause, wrongly remaining, or has an error/defect. The court identifies the second exigency as potentially applicable in this case. \n\nThe PDF document is dated February 15, 2023, and is related to the case C.O.

I am unable to agree. \n \n22.5 Once a mark is registered, Section 57 confers, on a person \naggrieved by the registration, the right to seek its cancellation and \nconsequent rectification of the register.  The circumstances in which \ncancellation and rectification can be sought are circumscribed within \nsub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 57.  Section 57(1) envisages \ncancellation or variation of the entry in the register where there is any \ncontravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register.  \nThat provision, quite clearly, does not apply to the present case. \n \n22.6 Section 57(2) envisages removal of a mark from the register \nwhere either (i) the entry is made in the register without sufficient \ncause or (ii) the entry is wrongly remaining in the register or (iii) there \nis any error or defect in the entry in the register.  If one or more of \nthese three exigencies exists, the mark can either be expunged or \nvaried from the register.  \n \n22.7 Of these three exigencies, the only exigency which could apply \nin the present case is the second i.e., that the defendant‟s mark is \n                                                                                                                   \nthe earlier trade mark. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified",

          "summary": "According to page 17 of the PDF \"Bennet, Coleman and Company v. Vnow Technologies Pvt Ltd.\", the court discusses the concept of a mark \"wrongly remaining on the register\" under the Trade Marks Act. The plaintiff's counsel, Ms. Mamta Rani Jha, argues that the impugned mark was not entitled to registration and its continuance on the register is impermissible. The court examines Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, which deals with grounds for refusal of registration. The judge, Hon'ble Mr. Justice C. Hari Shankar, opines that Section 11(5) does not apply differently at the stage of registration and rectification. The case is listed as C.O.

Etymologically, a mark \ncould be regarded as “wrongly remaining on the register” either (i) \nwhere it was correctly registered but, owing to intervening \ncircumstances, its continuance on the register is impermissible, or (ii) \nwhere its very registration was bad, as the mark was non-registerable \non account of one or more of the grounds envisaged in Sections 9 and \n11 of the Trade Marks Act.   I need not concern myself with the first \nof these two exigencies, as Ms Mamta Rani Jha has squarely relied on \nSection 11(1), (2) and (3), which imperil the very entitlement of the \nmark to registration, to canvass her case.  Ms Jha‟s submission is, \ntherefore, that, as the impugned \n mark was not entitled to \nregistration and was, nonetheless, registered, its continuance on the \nregister was impermissible in law; in other words, that it was \n“wrongly remaining on the register”.  \n \n22.8 The entitlement of the impugned mark to registration and the \nentitlement of the opponent of the mark to seek its cancellation or \nvariation, thus, statutorily dovetail into one another.  To be able to \nsuccessfully contend that the respondent‟s \n mark was liable to \nbe cancelled or varied, Ms Jha would have to successfully invoke one \nor more of the sub-sections of Section 9 or Section 11.  All the rigours \nwhich statutorily apply to these provisions, and their invocability, \nwould also, therefore, apply to Ms Jha‟s attempt to do so.    \n \n22.9 I am, therefore, of the considered opinion that Section 11(5) \ndoes not apply differently at the stage when the application for \nregistration of a mark is under consideration and when an application \nfor rectification of the register and removal of a mark therefrom, under \nSection 57(2), has been made.  Section 11(5) operates as a proviso to \nSections 11(2) and 11(3), by excepting their applicability to cases in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:15.02.2023\n12:48:02\nSignature Not Verified",
