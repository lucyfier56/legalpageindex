    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: Anubhav Jain vs. Satish Kumar Jain & Anr. (2023/DHC/000233)**\n\n**Background:**\nThe case involves a petition filed by Anubhav Jain, a Director of M/s. Jain Shikanji Private Limited (JSPL), under Sections 57 and 125 of the Trademarks Act, 1999. The petition seeks to cancel a registered device mark (Certificate No. 2772286) granted to Respondent 1, Satish Kumar Jain, on June 18, 2021. Additionally, the petitioner seeks rectification of the register of trademarks by removing the said registered trademark of Respondent 1.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe primary issue in this case is the maintainability of the petition, which was raised by Respondent 1 as a preliminary objection. The objection is based on Section 124 of the Trademarks Act, 1999. The court needs to determine whether the petition is maintainable and whether the registrar or the High Court has jurisdiction to hear the matter.\n\n**Arguments:**\nThe petitioner's counsel, Ms. Kangan Roda, argued in favor of the maintainability of the petition. On the other hand, Respondent 1's counsel, Mr. Gaurav Barathi, raised the preliminary objection, citing Section 124 of the Trademarks Act.\n\n**Court Findings:**\nAfter hearing the arguments, the Hon'ble Mr. Justice C. Hari Shankar directed that the preliminary objection be taken up and decided first. The court noted that Respondent 1 had filed a suit (CS (Comm) 171/2021) against the petitioner in September 2021, which may be relevant to the maintainability of the present petition.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe court decided to hear and decide the preliminary objection first, as directed on September 23, 2022. The decision on the maintainability of the petition would determine the course of the proceedings. Unfortunately, the provided document does not contain the final decision on the preliminary objection or the outcome of the case.\n\n**Key Sections of the Trademarks Act, 1999:**\n\n* Section 57: Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register.\n* Section 124: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided document, but it is likely related to the jurisdiction of the court or the registrar in trademark matters.\n* Section 125: Application for rectification of register to be made to High Court in certain cases.\n\nThe case highlights the complexities of trademark law and the importance of procedural compliance in intellectual property disputes. The court's decision on the preliminary objection will be crucial in determining the outcome of the case.",

Power to cancel or vary registration and to rectify the register.—(1) \n On application made in the \nprescribed manner to the High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved, the Registrar or the High \nCourt, as the case may be, may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration \nof a trade mark on the ground of any contravention, or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in \nrelation thereto. \n(2)  \nAny person aggrieved by the absence or omission from the register of any entry, or by any entry \nmade in the register without sufficient cause, or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register, or by any \nerror or defect in any entry in the register, may apply in the prescribed manner to the High Court or to the \nRegistrar, and the Registrar or the High Court, as the case may be, may make such order for making, \nexpunging or varying the entry as it may think fit. \n(3) \n The Registrar or the High Court, as the case may be, may in any proceeding under this section \ndecide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection with the rectification of the \nregister. \n(4)  \nThe Registrar or the High Court, as the case may be, of its own motion, may, after giving notice in \nthe prescribed manner to the parties concerned and after giving them an opportunity of being heard, make any \norder referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). \n(5)  \nAny order of the High Court rectifying the register shall direct that notice of the rectification shall \nbe served upon the Registrar in the prescribed manner who shall upon receipt of such notice rectify the \nregister accordingly. \n2 125.

By order dated 5th\n4. \nThe circumstances in which the aforesaid objection has been \nraised by Respondent 1, have, in the first instance, to be noted.  On \n23\n September 2022, this Court \ndirected that the said objection would be taken up and decided in the \nfirst instance. \n \n3. \nI have heard Mr. Gaurav Barathi, learned Counsel for \nRespondent 1 and Ms. Kangan Roda, learned Counsel for petitioner at \nlength, on the said objection as raised by Respondent 1 and proceed to \ndecide the objection by this order. \n \nrd\n                                                                                                                   \nmade to the Registrar under Section 47 or Section 57, the Registrar may, if he thinks fit, refer the application \nat any stage of the proceedings to the High Court. \n September 2021, Respondent 1 filed CS (Comm) 171/2021 \nagainst the petitioner before the learned Commercial Court, \nKarkardooma (“the learned Trial Court”, hereinafter), alleging that the \nmanner in which the petitioner was using the mark “JAIN SHIKANJI” \nwas same as plaintiff’s registerered mark “JAIN SHIKANJI”.

(COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 3 of 13 \n \nby Respondent 1 in the said suit. \n \n5. \nBy order dated 5th November 2022, the learned Trial Court \nallowed Respondent 1’s application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and \n2 of the CPC and passed an interlocutary order of injunction against \nthe petitioner.  The petitioner has challenged the said decision by way \nof FAO (Comm)185/2022, which is presently pending before a \nDivision Bench of this Court. Admittedly, no interlocutory orders \nhave been passed in the said appeal, till date. \n \n6. \nWhile proceedings emanating from CS (Comm) 171/2022 stood \nthus, the petitioner instituted the present petition before this Court \nunder Section 57 of the TradeMarks Act, seeking, as already noted, \ncancellation of the registration granted to the \n \ntrademark of Respondent 1 and consequent rectification of the trade \nmark register. \n \n7. \nMr. Barathi, learned Counsel for Respondent 1 contests the \nmaintainability of the present petition, relying for the said purpose, on \nSection 124 of the Trademarks Act. \n \n8. \nSection 124 of the Trademarks Act sets out a specific scheme.  \nPlainly read, it applies only where there is, to begin with, a suit, \nalleging infringement of trademark, pending before a Civil Court.  Mr. \nBarathi submits that CS (Comm) 171/2021 is the suit, instituted by \nRespondent 1 against the petitioner, on the basis of which he invokes \nSection 124. \n \n9. \nSection 124 proceeds to envisage two situations, under clauses \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 4 of 13 \n \n(a) and (b) of sub-section 1 thereof.  Of these, Mr. Barathi concedes \nthat Clause (b) does not apply. \n \n10. \nClause (a) of Section 124(1) applies where, in a suit for \ninfringement of a trademark, the defendant pleads that registration of \nthe plaintiff’s trade mark is invalid.  In CS (Comm) 171/2021, JSPL is \nthe defendant and Respondent 1 is the plaintiff. \n \n11. \nIn order for Section 124(1)(a) would apply, therefore, it would \nbe necessary for JSPL, as the defendant in CS (Comm) 171/2021, to \nhave pleaded, in that suit, that the registration of Respondent 1’s \ntrademark is invalid.  Ms. Roda, learned Counsel for the petitioner, \nsubmitted that this requirement, which is a pre-condition for Section \n124 to apply, was itself not satisfied, as JSPL never pleaded, as a \ndefence to CS(Comm) 171/2021, invalidity of Respondent 1’s \n trademark. \n \n12. \nThough Mr. Barathi initially sought to submit that such a \npleading had been made by the petitioner, he, thereafter, on perusing \nthe record acknowledging that, in the written statement, filed by way \nof reply to CS(Comm) 171/2021, no such plea of invalidity of \nRespondent 1’s \n trademark has been \nraised, though he submits that, in FAO(Comm) 185/2022, the \npetitioner has so averred.  \n \n13. \nEven on this sole ground, therefore, it would be apparent that \nSection 124 would not apply in the present case at all. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 5 of 13 \n \n14. \nProceeding further with the ingredients of Section 124, where \nthe case falls within Clause (a) or (b) of the first part of Section 124, \nthe provision goes on to deal again, with two situations, in Clause (i) \nand (ii) which follow in the second part of the section.  Between these \nclauses, too, Mr. Barathi acknowledge that clause (i) would not apply, \nas no proceedings for rectification of the register, instituted by the \npetitioner, were pending at the time when CS (Comm) 171/2022 was \nfiled or was being taken up by the learned Trial Court.  He, however, \npresses into service clause (ii).   \n \n15. \nClause (ii) in Section 124 states that,  \n(a) if  no proceedings for rectification of the register, in relation \nto the trademark of either of the parties in the suit, is pending \nbefore the Registrar of Trademarks, and \n(b) the Court is satisfied that the plea regarding invalidity of \nregistration, as raised in the suit is, prima facie, tenable, then, \nthe Court is required to  \n(i) raise an issue regarding the validity of the contested \ntrademark and  \n(b) adjourn a case for three months in order to enable the \nparty assailing the validity of the contested trademark to \napply to the High Court (earlier the learned IPAB) for \nrectification of the register. \n \n16. \nThis clause, too, on its face, does not apply as no plea of \ninvalidity of the registration of Respondent 1’s mark was urged by the \npetitioner, as the defendant in CS Comm) 171/2021. \n \n17. \nAssuming such a plea had been raised, what the clause \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 6 of 13 \n \nenvisages, in a situation where no proceeding for rectification of the \nregister of trade mark is pending and the learned Trial Court is \nsatisfied regarding prima facie tenability of the plea regarding \ninvalidity of the registration of the trade mark, as raised as a defence \nin the suit, is that the learned Trial Court would, then, raise an issue \nregarding validity of the contested trademark and adjourn the case for \nthree months to enable the contesting defendant to apply to the High \nCourt (earlier the learned IPAB) for rectification of the register of \ntrade marks.  \n \n18. \nSection 124, therefore, applies in certain specific circumstances, \nenvisaged in that provision and in none else.  These may be \nenumerated thus : \n(i)In the first instance, there must be a suit by a plaintiff against \na defendant alleging infringement, by the defendant, of the \nplaintiff’s trademark.  \n(ii)The defendant must, in the said suit, raise as a plea in \ndefense, invalidity of the plaintiff’s trademark.   \n(iii)At that time, no proceedings for rectification should be \npending.   \n(iv)The learned Trial Court hearing the suit, should be satisfied, \nprima facie, that the plea of invalidity of the plaintiff’s \ntrademark, as raised by the defendant, is tenable.   \nWhere all these circumstances coalesce, Section 124 requires the \nlearned Trial Court to raise an issue regarding validity of the \nplaintiff’s trademark and adjourned the case in order to enable the \ndefendant to move the appropriate forum— now the High Court—for \nrectification of the register. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 7 of 13 \n \n19. \nApart from the fact that, in the facts of the present case, Section \n124 has no application, as the petitioner never raised, in its written \nstatement by way of defence to CS (Comm) 171/2021 instituted by \nRespondent 1, a plea of invalidity of Respondent 1’s trademark as a \nground of defence.  Even otherwise, Section 124 cannot possibly be \nread in a manner as to defeat the right of the petitioner (defendant in \nthe suit) to defend the independent right of the petitioner to invoke \nSection 57 of the Trademarks Act, seeking rectification of the register \nof trademark and cancellation of the trademark of Respondent 1.  That \nas an independent right, independently conferrred by Section 57 of the \nTrademarks Act.   \n \n20. \nIn fact, the judgment of the Supreme Court in Patel Field \nMarshal Agencies v. P.M. Diesels Ltd3\n“29.  \nThe above seems to become more clear from what is to be \nfound in Section 111 of the 1958 Act which deals with \"stay of \nproceedings where the validity of registration of the trade mark is \nquestioned\". The aforesaid provision of the 1958 Act specifically \nprovides that if a proceeding for rectification of the register in \nrelation to the trade mark of either the Plaintiff or the Defendant is \npending before the Registrar or the High Court, as may be, and a \nsuit for infringement is filed wherein the aforesaid plea is raised \neither by the Defendant or by the Plaintiff, the suit shall remain \nstayed. Section 111 further provides if no proceedings for \nrectification are pending on the date of filing of the suit and the \nissue of validity of the registration of the Plaintiff's or the \nDefendant's trade mark is raised/arises subsequently and the same \nis prima facie found to be tenable, an issue to the aforesaid effect \nshall be framed by the Civil Court and the suit will remain stayed \nfor a period of three months from the date of framing of the issue \nso as to enable the concerned party to apply to the High Court for \nrectification of the register. Section 111(2) of the 1958 Act \nprovides that in case an application for rectification is filed within \nthe time allowed the trial of the suit shall remain stayed. Sub-\nsection (3) of Section 111 provides that in the event no such \n,  on which Mr. Barathi sought \nto place reliance, underscores this position.  Mr. Barathi emphasized \nparas 29, 31, 34 and 35 of the said decision, which read thus: \n                                          \n3 (2018) 2 SCC 112 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 8 of 13 \n \napplication for rectification is filed despite the order passed by the \nCivil Court, the plea with regard to validity of the registration of \nthe trade mark in question shall be deemed to have been \nabandoned and the suit shall proceed in respect of any other issue \nthat may have been raised therein. Sub-section (4) of Section 111 \nprovides that the final order as may be passed in the rectification \nproceeding shall bind the parties and the civil court will dispose of \nthe suit in conformity with such order insofar as the issue with \nregard to validity of the registration of the trade mark is concerned.  \n \n***** \n31.  \nRather, from the resume of the provisions of the 1958 Act \nmade above it becomes clear that all questions with regard to the \nvalidity of a Trade Mark is required to be decided by the Registrar \nor the High Court under the 1958 Act or by the Registrar or the \nIPAB under the 1999 Act and not by the Civil Court. The Civil \nCourt, infact, is not empowered by the Act to decide the said \nquestion. Furthermore, the Act mandates that the decisions \nrendered by the prescribed statutory authority [Registrar/High \nCourt (now IPAB)] will bind the Civil Court. At the same time, the \nAct (both old and new) goes on to provide a different procedure to \ngovern the exercise of the same jurisdiction in two different \nsituations. In a case where the issue of invalidity is raised or arises \nindependent of a suit, the prescribed statutory authority will be the \nsole authority to deal with the matter. However, in a situation \nwhere a suit is pending (whether instituted before or after the filing \nof a rectification application) the exercise of jurisdiction by the \nprescribed statutory authority is contingent on a finding of the \nCivil Court as regards the prima facie tenability of the plea of \ninvalidity.  \n***** \n34.  \nThe intention of the legislature is clear. All issues relating \nto and connected with the validity of registration has to be dealt \nwith by the Tribunal and not by the civil court. In cases where the \nparties have not approached the civil court, Sections 46 and 56 \nprovide an independent statutory right to an aggrieved party to \nseek rectification of a trade mark. However, in the event the Civil \nCourt is approached, inter alia, raising the issue of invalidity of the \ntrade mark such plea will be decided not by the civil court but by \nthe Tribunal under the 1958 Act. The Tribunal will however come \ninto seisin of the matter only if the Civil Court is satisfied that an \nissue with regard to invalidity ought to be framed in the suit. Once \nan issue to the said effect is framed, the matter will have to go to \nthe Tribunal and the decision of the Tribunal will thereafter bind \nthe Civil Court. If despite the order of the civil court the parties do \nnot approach the Tribunal for rectification, the plea with regard to \nrectification will no longer survive. \n \n35.  \nThe legislature while providing consequences for non-\ncompliance with timelines for doing of any act must be understood \nto have intended such consequences to be mandatory in nature, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 55/2021  \nPage 9 of 13 \n \nthereby, also affecting the substantive rights of the parties. This is \nhow Section 111(3) of the 1958 Act has to be understood. That \napart, it is very much within the legislative domain to create legal \nfictions by incorporating a deeming Clause and the court will have \nto understand such statutory fictions as bringing about a real state \nof affairs between the parties and ushering in legal consequences \naffecting the parties unless, of course, there is any other contrary \nprovision in the statue. None exists in the 1958 Act to understand \nthe provisions of Section 111(3) in any other manner except that \nthe right to raise the issue of invalidity is lost forever if the \nrequisite action to move the High Court/IPAB (now) is not \ninitiated within the statutorily prescribed time frame.” \n \n21. \nMr. Barathi specifically stressed on the following sentences \nfrom para 30 of the said report. \n“In cases where the parties have not approached the civil court, \nSections 46 and 56 provide an independent statutory right to an \naggrieved party to seek rectification of a trade mark. However, in \nthe event the Civil Court is approached, inter alia, raising the issue \nof invalidity of the trade mark such plea will be decided not by the \ncivil court but by the Tribunal under the 1958 Act. The Tribunal \nwill however come into seisin of the matter only if the Civil Court \nis satisfied that an issue with regard to invalidity ought to be \nframed in the suit. Once an issue to the said effect is framed, the \nmatter will have to go to the Tribunal and the decision of the \nTribunal will thereafter bind the Civil Court.” \n \n22. \nMr. Barathi’s contention is that the afore-extracted passages \nfrom Patel Field Marshal Agencies1 clearly envisage that, once a suit \nfor infringement is filed by the plaintiff against the defendant, and the \ndefendant raises the plea of invalidity of the plaintiff’s mark as a \nground of defence in the said suit, the defendant loses all right to \nindependently invoke Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act to seek \nrectification of the register and cancellation of the plaintiff’s mark. \nAccording to him, the Supreme Court has clearly held that, in such \ncircumstances, the learned IPAB – now the High Court – would \nacquire seisin over the issue of validity of the plaintiff’s trademark \nonly where the matter suffers the drill of clause (ii) in the second part \nof Section 124 of the Trademarks Act, i.e. where the Court finds, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O.

It is only at that stage, submits Mr. Barathi, that the defendant \ncan move for rectification of the register of trade marks. Section 57, \ntherefore, according to Mr. Barathi, ceases to be available to a \ndefendant in a suit the moment the defendant raises a plea of invalidity \nof the plaintiff’s trademark as a ground of defence. \n \n23. \nI am unable to subscribe to this view. Indeed, in my considered \nopinion, Patel Field Marshal Agencies1\n24. \nThe sentences from the decision in Patel Field Marshal \nAgencies\n indicates to the contrary. \n \n1 extracted in para 21 (supra) and on which Mr. Barathi \nplaced reliance, in fact, clearly indicate that the right conferred on the \ndefendant in an infringement suit, to move the learned IPAB, or this \nCourt, for rectification of the register of marks is an independent right. \nThis clearly indicates that it is a right which is independent of other \nrights available under the Trade Marks Act for the same purpose. It \nhas, therefore, to be treated as available in addition to the right \navailable and conferred by Section 57.  It cannot be read as the only \nright available, in abrogation of Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act. \nThe position that emerges is, therefore, that, while the right under \nSection 57, for cancellation of a mark and rectification of the register \nremains available, of an infringement suit has been filed by the \nopposite party and the defendant pleads invalidity of the plaintiff’s \nmark as a ground of defence to the suit, the defendant would acquire \nan independent right under Clause (ii) of Section 124 of the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\n                            Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000233 \nC.O.

The first is that a judgment \nof the Supreme Court is to be read only as an authority for what it \n on which \nMr. Barathi placed reliance, merely set out the statutory scheme \navailable under Section 124 of the Trade Marks Act “equivalent to \nSection 111 of the Trade Marks Act, 1958, with which the Court was \nconcerned in that case. All that the Supreme Court has held is that, \nwhere the procedure under Clause (ii) of the second part of Section \n124 of the Trade Marks Act is set in motion, the learned IPAB, or the \nHigh Court, would acquire seisin over the issue of validity of the \ncontested trade mark only when, (i) in the first instance, the Civil \nCourt expresses prima facie agreement with the plea of invalidity as \nraised, (ii) an issue is framed in that regard, (iii) the matter is \nadjourned by the Civil Court and (iv) the defendant, thereafter, moves \nfor rectification of the register.

Ms. Roda, learned Counsel for the petitioner, \nsubmitted that this requirement, which is a pre-condition for Section \n124 to apply, was itself not satisfied, as JSPL never pleaded, as a \ndefence to CS(Comm) 171/2021, invalidity of Respondent 1’s \n trademark. \n \n12. \nThough Mr. Barathi initially sought to submit that such a \npleading had been made by the petitioner, he, thereafter, on perusing \nthe record acknowledging that, in the written statement, filed by way \nof reply to CS(Comm) 171/2021, no such plea of invalidity of \nRespondent 1’s \n trademark has been \nraised, though he submits that, in FAO(Comm) 185/2022, the \npetitioner has so averred.  \n \n13. \nEven on this sole ground, therefore, it would be apparent that \nSection 124 would not apply in the present case at all. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:13.01.2023\n15:40:34\nSignature Not Verified",

All that the Supreme Court has held is that, \nwhere the procedure under Clause (ii) of the second part of Section \n124 of the Trade Marks Act is set in motion, the learned IPAB, or the \nHigh Court, would acquire seisin over the issue of validity of the \ncontested trade mark only when, (i) in the first instance, the Civil \nCourt expresses prima facie agreement with the plea of invalidity as \nraised, (ii) an issue is framed in that regard, (iii) the matter is \nadjourned by the Civil Court and (iv) the defendant, thereafter, moves \nfor rectification of the register.

          "summary": "According to page 12 of the PDF \"25. Anubhav Jain v. Satish Kumar Jain & Anr.\", the court discusses the interpretation of Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act. The respondent's advocate, Mr. Barathi, argues that once an infringement suit is filed, the defendant loses the right to seek cancellation of the plaintiff's trademark under Section 57. However, the court disagrees, stating that the judgment in Patel Field Marshal Agencies does not support this contention. The court emphasizes that Section 57 is not subject to any other provision in the Trade Marks Act, and there is no non-obstante clause in Section 124 that would give it precedence over other provisions. The court cites references such as State of Orissa v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. N.R Vairamani to support its decision. (Source: 25. Anubhav Jain v.
