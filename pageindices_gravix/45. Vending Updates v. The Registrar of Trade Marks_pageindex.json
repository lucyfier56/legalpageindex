    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary**\n\n**Neutral Citation Number:** 2023/DHC/001144\n**C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 160/2022**\n\n**Appellant (Vending Updates India Private Limited)** vs **Respondent (Registrar of Trademarks)**\n\n**Background:**\nThe present appeal was filed by Vending Updates India Private Limited (appellant) against the order dated September 7, 2022, passed by the Senior Examiner in the office of the Registrar of Trademarks refusing registration to a device mark. The appellant had applied for registration of the mark in Class 30 covering various coffee and tea products.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe primary issue was whether the device mark resembled an identical/deceptively similar mark already registered in favour of Amazon Technologies, Inc., USA, which led to the objection raised by the Registrar of Trademarks under Section 11(1) of the Trademarks Act, 1999. The appellant contended that the senior examiner erred in sustaining the objection and rejected their application.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n*   Appellant argued that the Senior Examiner's decision was incorrect and unsustainable.\n*   Amazon Technologies INC provided a Letter of Consent dated January 3, 2023, where they consented to registration of the mark by Vending Updates India Private Limited in Classes 29 & 30 under Indian Application Nos. 4024217 & 4024218 respectively.\n*   Appellant submitted that with no objection now raised by Amazon, the impugned order was arbitrary and not justified.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nAfter considering the arguments presented, the Hon'ble Mr. Justice C. Hari Shankar found that:\n\n1. The Senior Examiner's decision to sustain the objection under Section 11(1) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, was incorrect.\n2. With Amazon consenting to the registration of the mark as desired by Vending Updates India Private Limited, there is no valid ground for refusing the application.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that Amazon has provided its consent and waived objections to the registration of the device mark in Classes 29 & 30, under Indian Application Nos. 4024217 & 4024218 respectively, and considering the findings of the Court, the Hon'ble Mr. Justice C. Hari Shankar passed a judgment that: \"Accordingly, this appeal is allowed for the reasons already stated.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe High Court of Delhi at New Delhi accepted the appeal and allowed it due to Amazon's Letter of Consent issued in favour of Vending Updates India Private Limited allowing them to proceed with registration.",
