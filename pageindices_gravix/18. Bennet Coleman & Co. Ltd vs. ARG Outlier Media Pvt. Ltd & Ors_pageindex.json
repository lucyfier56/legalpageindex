    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. v. ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd.**\n\n**Background:**\nThe present case is an application under Order XI Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) as applicable to commercial suits under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 filed by Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd., the plaintiff, against ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd. and others, the defendants, seeking to place on record additional documents.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe legal issue in this case revolves around whether the plaintiff can file additional documents 18 months after the filing of the suit, particularly when some of the documents pertain to a defendant (defendant no. 1) who had already been deleted from the array of parties.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* **Plaintiff:** Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the additional documents were necessitated due to statements made by the defendants in their written statement and replies to examination reports filed with the Trade Mark Registry, which contradicted their stand taken in the present suit. The plaintiff also sought to place on record these documents to demonstrate that defendant no. 1 was in existence at the time of filing of the suit.\n* **Defendants:** Senior counsel appearing for the defendants argued that since defendant no. 1 had already been deleted from the array of parties, the documents with regard to the defendant no. 1 are no longer relevant in the present suit. It was also contended that there is no contradiction in the stand taken by the defendants before the Trade Mark Registry and their written statement filed in the present suit.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\n* The Court observed that a perusal of the additional documents sought to be placed on record by the plaintiff would show that they are examination reports of the Registry and responses thereto by the defendants.\n* The Court noted that all the aforesaid documents pertain to the defendants, particularly defendant no. 2, who had taken a specific stand in their written statement that the trademark/taglines, which are the subject matter of the present suit are descriptive in nature.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe Court rejected the plaintiff's application under Order XI Rule 5 of the CPC for placing on record additional documents. The Court held that:\n\n* Since defendant no. 1 had already been deleted from the array of parties, the documents with regard to the defendant no. 1 are no longer relevant in the present suit.\n* There is no contradiction in the stand taken by the defendants before the Trade Mark Registry and their written statement filed in the present suit.\n\nThe Court relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sudhir Kumar v. Vinay Kumar (2021 SCC OnLine SC 734) and the judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Nitin Gupta v. Taxmaco Infrastructure & Holding Ltd. (2019 SCC OnLine Del 8367) to support its decision.\n\nIn light of these findings, the plaintiff's application was dismissed.",

JUSTICE AMIT BANSAL \n \nAMIT BANSAL, J. (Oral) \nI.A. 1464/2018 (O-XI R-5 of the CPC) \n1. \nThe present application has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff under \nOrder XI Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) as applicable \nto commercial suits under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 for placing on \nrecord additional documents.  \n2. \nReply has been filed on behalf of the defendants opposing the present \napplication. Rejoinder thereto, has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff.  \n3. \nIt is the case of the plaintiff that the aforesaid additional documents \nwere filed by the plaintiff on 17th October, 2017 on the same date as the \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\n2023/DHC/001726 \n \nCS(COMM) 434/2017                                                                                                      Page 2 of 6 \n \nreplication. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the filing of the aforesaid \ndocuments was necessitated on account of the statement made on behalf of \nthe defendants, as noted in the order dated 26th September, 2017, that the \ndefendant no.1 was not in existence at the time of the filing of the present \nsuit and some of the additional documents sought to be filed are to \ndemonstrate that the defendant no.1 was in existence at the time of filing of \nthe present suit. \n4. \nYet another justification given on behalf of the plaintiff for filing \nadditional documents is to demonstrate the contrary stands taken by the \ndefendants in their written statements and in the replies to the examination \nreports of the Registry. It is stated that in the written statements the \ndefendants have taken a stand that the trademarks/taglines, which are the \nsubject matter of the present suit are descriptive and generic in nature. \nHowever, in various replies to the examination reports of the Registry, the \ndefendants have taken a contrary stand. Therefore, it is necessary to place \nthe aforesaid documents on record. Reliance is placed on Order XI Rule (1) \n(c)(ii) of the CPC.  \n5. \nPer contra, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants \nsubmits that since the defendant no.1 has already been deleted from the \narray of parties, the documents with regard to the defendant no.1 are no \nlonger relevant in the present suit. It is further submitted that there is no \ncontradiction in the stand taken by the defendants before the Trade Mark \nRegistry and the written statement filed in the present suit. It is also \ncontended that the documents now sought to be filed were in the power, \npossession, control and custody of the plaintiff at the time of filing of the \npresent suit and therefore, ought to have been filed along with the suit. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\n2023/DHC/001726 \n \nCS(COMM) 434/2017                                                                                                      Page 3 of 6 \n \nReliance is being placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sudhir \nKumar v. Vinay Kumar, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 734 and the judgment of a \nCo-ordinate Bench of this Court in Nitin Gupta v. Taxmaco Infrastructure \n& Holding Ltd., 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8367.  \n6. \nI have heard the counsel for the parties.  \n7. \nA perusal of the additional documents sought to be placed on record \nby the plaintiff would show that the said documents are the examination \nreports of the Registry and the responses thereto by the defendants. All the \naforesaid documents pertain to the defendants. Attention of the Court has \nbeen drawn by the counsel for the plaintiff to paragraph 18 of the written \nstatement filed by the defendant no.2, where a specific stand has been taken \nby the defendants that the trademark/taglines, which are the subject matter \nof the present suit are descriptive in nature. The aforesaid contention has \nbeen rebutted by the plaintiff in its replication. In order to meet the aforesaid \ncontention of the defendants, the plaintiff seeks to place on record the \naforesaid documents to show that in their replies to the examination reports, \nthe defendants have claimed the trademark to be distinctive. The aforesaid \ndocuments are covered within the ambit of sub-rule (1)(c)(ii) of Rule (1) of \nOrder XI of the CPC in terms of which the plaintiff would be entitled to file \nthe documents in response to a case set up by the defendants after filing of \nthe plaint. Therefore, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants \nthat the aforesaid documents were available in public domain and could \nhave been filed along with the plaint. Even if the said documents were \navailable in public domain at the time of filing of the suit, the need for filing \nthe aforesaid documents arose only on account of the stand taken by the \ndefendants in the written statement.  \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n2023/DHC/001726 \n \nCS(COMM) 434/2017                                                                                                      Page 4 of 6 \n \n8. \nInsofar as the objection of the defendants that the documents in \nrespect of the defendant no.1 are not relevant as the defendant no.1 has been \ndeleted from the array of the parties, it is the contention of the plaintiff that \ndespite the defendants claiming that the defendant no.1 was not in existence, \ncertain replies were filed on behalf of the defendant no.1 before the Trade \nMark Registry. Therefore, the aforesaid documents are relevant for \ndetermining whether an incorrect stand has been taken by the defendant or \nnot.   \n9. \nIn Sudhir Kumar (supra), relied upon by the defendants, the Supreme \nCourt was dealing with the provisions of Order XI Rule 1(4) read with Order \nXI Rule 1(5) of the CPC in respect of filing additional documents after filing \nof the plaint in case of urgent listings. It was further observed that the rigour \nof establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents along \nwith the plaint may not arise in cases where additional documents are \ndiscovered subsequent to filing of the plaint. The aforesaid judgment does \nnot in any manner curtail the power of the Court to permit additional \ndocuments to be taken on record if a party gives sufficient cause for not \nfiling the said documents along with the plaint.  \n10. \nThe judgment in Nitin Gupta (supra) relied upon by the defendants \nhas been distinguished in other judgments of the Co-ordinate Benches of this \nCourt in Hassad Food Company Q.S.C. v. Bank of India, 2019 SCC \nOnLine Del 10647 and Mahesh Chaudhri v. IMV India Pvt. Ltd., 2019 \nSCC OnLine Del 9813 on the ground that the issues in the said suit had \nalready been framed and the documents were inconsistent with the pleadings \nin the suit. In both the aforesaid cases, the additional documents were \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n2023/DHC/001726 \n \nCS(COMM) 434/2017                                                                                                      Page 5 of 6 \n \nallowed to be taken on record on the ground that the issues were yet to be \nframed in the suit and additional documents sought to be filed by the \nplaintiff were relevant for the adjudication of the case.  \n11. \nThe judgments in Hassad Food Company (supra), Mahesh \nChaudhri  (supra) and Nitin Gupta (supra) were considered by me in \nKhurmi Associates (P) Ltd. v. Maharishi Dayanand Co-Operative Group \nHousing Society, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 1011. Relying upon the judgments \nin Hassad Food Company (supra) and Mahesh Chaudhary (supra), the \nadditional documents were permitted to be taken on record on the ground \nthat issues were yet to be framed in the suit and the documents were in \nsupport of the pleadings of the plaintiff company.  \n12. \nThe facts in the present case are very similar to the facts in Khurmi \nAssociates (supra). Issues are yet to be framed in the suit. It is an admitted \nposition that the additional documents were filed on behalf of the plaintiff \non the same date as the replication. A perusal of the pleadings in the suit \nwould also show that the aforesaid documents sought to be filed are not \ncontrary to the pleadings of the plaintiff in the suit. In my considered view, \nthe aforesaid documents would be relevant for the adjudication of the \npresent suit.  \n13. \nAccordingly, the present application is allowed and the plaintiff is \npermitted to place the additional documents on record, subject to payment of \ncosts of Rs.20,000/- to the defendants. \nCS(COMM) 434/2017 \n14. \nAffidavit of admission/denial in respect of additional documents \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n2023/DHC/001726 \n \nCS(COMM) 434/2017                                                                                                      Page 6 of 6 \n \npermitted to be taken on record shall be filed by the defendants within three \nweeks from today. \n15. \nList before the Joint Registrar on 19th April, 2023 for \nadmission/denial of the documents. \n \n \nAMIT BANSAL, J \nMARCH 6, 2023 \nat \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified\n"

All the \naforesaid documents pertain to the defendants. Attention of the Court has \nbeen drawn by the counsel for the plaintiff to paragraph 18 of the written \nstatement filed by the defendant no.2, where a specific stand has been taken \nby the defendants that the trademark/taglines, which are the subject matter \nof the present suit are descriptive in nature. The aforesaid contention has \nbeen rebutted by the plaintiff in its replication. In order to meet the aforesaid \ncontention of the defendants, the plaintiff seeks to place on record the \naforesaid documents to show that in their replies to the examination reports, \nthe defendants have claimed the trademark to be distinctive. The aforesaid \ndocuments are covered within the ambit of sub-rule (1)(c)(ii) of Rule (1) of \nOrder XI of the CPC in terms of which the plaintiff would be entitled to file \nthe documents in response to a case set up by the defendants after filing of \nthe plaint. Therefore, there is no merit in the submission of the defendants \nthat the aforesaid documents were available in public domain and could \nhave been filed along with the plaint. Even if the said documents were \navailable in public domain at the time of filing of the suit, the need for filing \nthe aforesaid documents arose only on account of the stand taken by the \ndefendants in the written statement.  \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:07.03.2023 19:21:29\nSignature Not Verified",

The defendants objected, citing Supreme Court judgments in Sudhir Kumar, Nitin Gupta, Hassad Food Company, and Mahesh Chaudhri.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\nThe court allowed the plaintiff's application, relying on its own judgment in Khurmi Associates (P) Ltd. v.

The court held that:\n\n* Even if the documents were filed after the replication, they could still be added to the record if they support the pleadings and are relevant for the adjudication of the case.\n* The fact that issues had not been framed in the suit and the additional documents were relevant for the determination of the case weighed in favor of allowing them to be added.\n\n**Orders:**\n\nThe court permitted the plaintiff to add the additional documents to the record, subject to payment of costs of Rs. 20,000 to the defendants.",

Therefore, the aforesaid documents are relevant for \ndetermining whether an incorrect stand has been taken by the defendant or \nnot.   \n9. \nIn Sudhir Kumar (supra), relied upon by the defendants, the Supreme \nCourt was dealing with the provisions of Order XI Rule 1(4) read with Order \nXI Rule 1(5) of the CPC in respect of filing additional documents after filing \nof the plaint in case of urgent listings. It was further observed that the rigour \nof establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents along \nwith the plaint may not arise in cases where additional documents are \ndiscovered subsequent to filing of the plaint. The aforesaid judgment does \nnot in any manner curtail the power of the Court to permit additional \ndocuments to be taken on record if a party gives sufficient cause for not \nfiling the said documents along with the plaint.  \n10. \nThe judgment in Nitin Gupta (supra) relied upon by the defendants \nhas been distinguished in other judgments of the Co-ordinate Benches of this \nCourt in Hassad Food Company Q.S.C. v.
