(hereinafter referred to as \"Promoshirt\"), applied for registration of two trademarks: \n    *   (i) \"SWISS MILITARY\" in Class 25 in respect of clothing, readymade garments, footwear, headgear, coats, overcoats, jackets, jerseys, undergarments, socks.\n    *   (ii) the mark \\[in a circle\\] in Class 25 in respect of textile industries.\\]\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n*   The Appellant opposed Promoshirt's applications for registration on grounds that the marks in question violate various statutory proscriptions.\n*   Promoshirt claimed it had no objection to using the logo, but wanted the appellation \"SWISS MILITARY\" and the red background design \\[in a circle\\]  registered along with it.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n*   **Appellant's Argument:** Mr. Pravin Anand for the Appellant argued that:\n    +   The Appellant has no objection to using the logo per se (white cross on a black background) but objects to using either \"SWISS MILITARY\" or \\[in a circle\\] with an red background and appellation.\n    +   Both marks cannot be permitted due to statutory proscriptions.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\n*   **Appellate Tribunal (APF):**\n    -   Section \n    -   According to s. 12(2) of TM Act, there should not be any likelihood of the public being influenced into purchasing one mark because of association with another mark.\n    -   In assessing whether Respondent’s marks are deceptively similar to Appellant’s marks, there is evidence of Promoshirt using cross emblem and the mark in question (a white cross on a red background) together.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n*   **Condonation of Contravention:** The Court stated that under the Trade Marks Act 1999 condoning the contravention would be against s.12(2) - there being an unacceptable risk of confusion, which requires disallowing both the Respondent’s marks.\n*   Both applications for registration are rejected.",

Submissions advanced at \nthe bar by both sides are also overlapping.  As such, they have been \ntaken up and disposed of together. \n \n2. \nThe appellant is a Federal Agency of the Swiss Federation, and \nprocures armaments for Switzerland‘s Federal Department of \nDefence, Civil Protection and Sport. The appellant, therefore, \nrepresents, essentially, the military wing of the Swiss Government.   \n \n3. \nRespondent 2, in these appeals, Promoshirt SM S.A. \n(―Promoshirt‖, hereinafter) applied to the Registrar of Trademarks, \nNew Delhi for registration of the trademarks (i) ―SWISS \nMILITARY‖ in Class 25 in respect of clothing, readymade garments, \nfootwear, headgear, coats, overcoats, jackets, jerseys, undergarments, \nsocks‖ and (ii) \nthe mark \n in Class 25 in respect of ―textile \nindustries‖.   Both applications were on ―proposed to be used‖ basis.  \nThe appellant opposed the applications.  The opposition of the \nappellant was rejected, and the trademarks were permitted registration \nby the learned Deputy Registrar of Trademarks vide separate orders \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 3 of 79 \n \n \ndated 25th July 2022.  The appellant has, by means of these appeals, \nassailed the said orders and, therefore, contested the right of the \naforesaid trademarks ―SWISS MILITARY‖ and \n to registration  \nunder the Trademarks Act, 1999 (―the Trademarks Act‖). \n \n4. \nI may note, here, the appellant‘s precise grievance.  Mr. Pravin \nAnand, appearing for the appellant, submits that the appellant has no \nobjection to Respondent 2 using the \n logo per se, as a white cross \non a black background, for its products.  His client, however, seriously \nobjects to Respondent 2 being permitted to register or use either (i) a \nwhite cross on a red background, i.e. \n or (ii) the appellation \n―SWISS MILITARY‖.  Neither mark, submits Mr Anand, can be \npermitted either to be registered or used, in view of various statutory \nproscriptions which are in place.  What Respondent 2 actually uses, he \nseeks to point out, is \n, i.e. a white cross on a red background with \nthe ―SWISS MILITARY‖ appellation below it.   \n \n5. \nInasmuch as the impugned order dated 25th July 2022, read with \nSection 10(2)1 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, allows Respondent 2 to \ndo so, the appellant calls the said order into question in these appeals. \n \n6. \nMr. Akhil Sibal, at the very outset of his submissions, submitted \nthat his client was willing to restrict the registration of the impugned \nmark to a black and white colour combination, without using red.  He, \n                                          \n1 10.  \nLimitation as to colour. –  \n***** \n(2)  \nSo far as a trade mark is registered without limitation of colour, it shall be deemed to be \nregistered for all colours. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 4 of 79 \n \n \nhowever, acknowledges that his client has other registrations for the \nwhite cross on a red background, i.e. \n, but states that those \nregistrations are not subject matter of appeal.  Mr Sibal would seek to \nnip these proceedings in the bud by submitting that, in view of the \nconcession he makes, the grievance of the appellant, which is \nrestricted to the use of the mark in a red-and-white colour \ncombination, would stand assuaged. \n \n7. \nEven if all submissions of Mr Anand were to be accepted, \nsubmits Mr. Sibal, the sequitur would not be the setting aside of the \nimpugned order, but limitation of the registration of the impugned \nmark to a black-and-white colour combination.  He also points out that \nthe requirement for the application specifying the colour in which the \nregistration of the mark was sought was introduced only in 2002, \nwhereas the application of Respondent 2 was of 1999.   \n  \n8. \nMr. Anand does not take kindly to the suggestion.  He submits – \nand justifiably, I feel – that Respondent 2 cannot seek to truncate these \nproceedings by the above concession, thereby leaving the appellant to \nfight the battle against the red-and-white \n  mark all over again for \nanother day, while it continues to use the said mark, in violation of the \nlaw.  He also submits that he seriously disputes the entitlement, to \nregistration, of the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ appellation as well.    \n \n9. \nI agree with Mr Anand.  Respondent 2, in making the above \nconcession and seeking a closure to these proceedings on that basis, is \nbeing less than fair.  Mr Sibal, with characteristic candour, \nacknowledged that, despite having offered the concession on \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 5 of 79 \n \n \ninstructions, his client was not going to desist from continuing to use \nthe red-and-white \n mark, or the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ appellation \nbelow it, as it had subsisting registrations in that regard, which have \nnot been challenged.   In that view of the matter, I see no justification \nfor truncating these proceedings on the basis of the concession \nextended by Mr Sibal.   \n \n10. \nHad the impugned order restricted the grant of registration to \nthe impugned mark to the white cross on a black background, i.e. \n, \nthen, perhaps, the appellant might not have been entitled to challenge \nthe use of the \n mark in these proceedings, as the challenge would \nhave travelled outside the scope of the impugned order, and would \nhave assailed an entitlement that the impugned order did not grant.  As \nthings stand, however, by virtue of Section 10(2)1 of the Trade Marks \nAct, the impugned order permits the use, by Respondent 2, of the \nwhite cross on a background of any colour (which would include red).  \nRespondent 2 avowedly uses, and intends to continue to use, the white \ncross on the red background, as \n, with the appellation ―SWISS \nMILITARY‖ below it.  The appellant cannot, therefore, in these \nproceedings, be foreclosed the right to challenge the entitlement, to \nregistration, of the  \n  or the ―SWISS MILITARY‖ marks, used \neither independently or in conjunction with each other.   \n     \n11. \nMr. Sibal‘s submission that, if Mr. Anand‘s submissions were \nto be accepted, the sequitur would only be limiting the grant of \nregistration to the impugned mark to a black and white combination, \nin my opinion, is bereft of substance.

The impugned order allows registration of the impugned \nmark without limitation of colour.  This Court is seized with the \ncorrectness of the impugned order.  Its brief is not, therefore, limited \nor restricted to modifying the impugned order in a manner it deems \nappropriate – though, undoubtedly, as an appellate Court, it can do so.  \nThe Court is well within its jurisdiction, therefore, to adjudicate on \nwhether Respondent 1 can be permitted registration, of the impugned \nmark, in any colour, not merely in black-and-white.   Inasmuch as the \nimpugned order, read with Section 10(2)1, deems the impugned mark \nto be registered in all colours, the concession advanced by Mr Sibal, to \nthe effect that his client is willing to let the impugned registration be \nlimited to black-and-white, does not in any way render the discussion \nacademic, especially in view of Mr Sibal‘s admission that his client \nhas no intention to restrict use of the impugned mark to the black-and-\nwhite format, as it has subsisting registrations specifically for the red-\nand-white format which are not under challenge.   \n \n12. \nI queried of Mr. Anand as to whether the appellant was also \nobjecting to the use, by the respondents, of \n, i.e. where the white \ncross was on a black background.  Mr. Anand responded by \nsubmitting that if the respondents were willing to forgo the words \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘ below the logo and were merely using the \nwhite cross on a black background, i.e. \n, his client would have no \nobjection to such use. \n \n13. \nMr. Sibal, needless to say, was not willing to restrict the \nimpugned registration to a white cross on a black background without \nthe words ―SWISS MILITARY‖. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 7 of 79 \n \n \n14. \nThe battle lines thus stand drawn. \n \n15. \nI would, therefore, be examining only whether the \n mark, \ndepicting a white cross on a red background, and the ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ word mark, individually or in conjunction with each \nother, can be registered.   \n \n16. \nThere being no dispute on facts, and the issue in controversy \nbeing the entitlement of the trademarks ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ and \nto registration, one may proceed directly to the rival submissions \nmade by learned Counsel before me. \n \nCA(COMM.IPD-TM) 159/2022 \n \n \nSubmissions of Mr. Pravin Anand on behalf of the appellant \nArmasuisse  \n \n17. \nMr. Pravin Anand, learned Counsel for the appellant initially \naddressed arguments on CA(COMM.IPD-TM) 159/2022, which was \ndirected against the order which rejected the appellant‘s opposition \nand allowed registration of the trademark \nby Respondent 2. \n \n18. \nRespondent 2 applied, on 8th November 2000, for registration of \nthe \n mark for textile on a ―proposed to be used‖ basis.

He has invited my attention, in this context, to para 26 of \nthe notice of opposition filed by the appellant to Promoshirt‘s \napplication for registration of the impugned mark, which reads thus: \n \n―26. \n The registration of the impugned mark would amount to \n\"false trade description\" as per the provisions of Section 2(i)(I) and \nSection 2(i)(IV)(a) and hence cause irreparable damage and \nhardship in the related business and to the public at large.‖ \n \nMr. Anand points out, on the basis of the invoices submitted by \nRespondent 2 with its application for registration, that the goods in \nrespect of which Respondent 2 was using the impugned mark were \nmanufactured in China, not in Switzerland and that, therefore, by \nusing the appellation ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ and the distinctive red \ncross which constitutes Switzerland‘s insignia, Respondent 2 was \nseeking to make it appear that goods were of Swiss origin which \namounted to a ―false trade description‖. \n \n22. \nIn this context, Mr. Pravin Anand also drew my attention to Tax \nInvoice dated 12th July 2008, issued by Swiss Military Products SA \n(as  Respondent 2 was earlier named) to Bausch & Lomb India Ltd, in \n                                                                                                                   \n7 11.  \nRelative grounds for refusal of registration. –  \n***** \n(3)  \nA trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in India is liable to be \nprevented –  \n(a)  \nby virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off protecting an \nunregistered trade mark used in the course of trade;  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 10 of 79 \n \n \nrespect of a laptop shoulder bag, bearing the impugned mark, albeit in \nthe form of a white cross on a red background, in which the amount \nchargeable was reflected as ₹ 1,11,112.50.  Mr. Anand submits that \nthe ₹ symbol for the Rupee came into force only on 15th July 2010, \nwhich was more than two years after the aforesaid invoice was issued, \nfor which purpose he placed reliance on a Cabinet Circular dated 15th \nJuly 2010 released by the Press Information Bureau, Government of \nIndia, approving, on that day, the symbol ‗₹‘ for the Indian rupee.  \nHaving, therefore, furnished a fabricated invoice in support of its \napplication, Promoshirt was, according to Mr. Pravin Anand, ex facie \ndisentitled to registration.  Mr. Anand points out that there is no \nfinding in the impugned order on this objection by the appellant. \n \n23. \nMr. Anand next submits that there is yet another aspect on \nwhich the application of the respondents for registration compromises \non truth.  He refers me to the record of Registration No. A-\n71091/2005 dated 29th April 2005, whereby copyright registration was \ngranted by the copyright office of the Government of India to the \nartistic work \n.  He pointed out that, in the application for \nregistration, the applicant was shown to be Mr Jean Luk Boegli, of \nIndian nationality, c/o Ashok Sawhney, W-41, Okhla Industrial Area, \nPhase II, New Delhi.  Mr. Jean Luk Boegli was also shown, in the said \napplication, to be the author of the copyright; again, of Indian \nnationality.  The form also disclosed that the first publication of the \nimpugned mark was in 1989 in India and that the publisher was also \nof Indian nationality.  The date on which the application for copyright \nregistration was made was reflected as 17th March 2004.  \n \n24. \nMr. Anand has drawn my attention to an official Certificate \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 11 of 79 \n \n \ndated 19th July 2006, on the reverse side of a Power of Attorney \ngranted by Mr. Jean Luk Boegli in favour of Ashok Sawhney, CEO of \nRespondent 2, in which the date of birth of Mr. Jean Luk Boegli is \nreflected as 16th July 1976.  By that reckoning, submits Mr. Pravin \nAnand, Mr. Jean Luk Boegli, in 1989, would have been 13 years of \nage.  He submits that it is inconceivable that a 13 year old boy would \ncreate the \n logo.  Accordingly, he submits that the Respondent 2 \nhas resorted to misrepresentation even while seeking copyright \nregistration for the impugned logo. \n \n25. \nMr. Anand next referred me to various avertisements and trade \npromotion catalogues, etc., in which Promoshirt was promoting the \nimpugned \n brand.  Mr. Anand points out that there were various \nrepresentations in the said advertisements/promotional campaigns \nintended at communicating a link between goods bearing the \n \nbrand and Switzerland.  In one of the advertisements, the Swiss flag \nwas shown with the Alps in the background.  In another \nadvertisement, the following recital was to be found: \n―Our motto of ‗Swiss quality at Affordable Prices‘ stems from the \nfact that the Corporate Gift segment today suffers from either \ninferior quality or exhorbitant prices.  This is the gap we intend to \nfill in with a mission to produce the best products available with \nthe most economically viable resources‖ \n \nThe ―India catalogue‖ for various goods such as travel gear, watches, \nwriting instruments, sunglasses, accessories, bicycles, electronics, \nalarm clocks, etc., brought out by Respondent 2, also shows a train in \na foreground with the snowclad Alps in the background.

Mr \nAnand relies on Section 1448 of the Trade Marks Act to submit that \nthe manner in which Respondent 2 was using the mark was relevant to \na decision on whether to allow, or not to allow, its registration.  He \nplaces reliance, for this purpose, on the decision of a coordinate Single \nBench of this Court in Louis Vuitton Malletier v. Manoj Khurana9. \n \n26. \nInvariably, submits Mr. Anand, Respondent 2 uses the \nimpugned logo with the white cross on a red background.  He has also \nshown me pictures of bag packs with the said logo and even produced, \nin the Court, a physical sample of such a bag pack.  A photograph of \none such bag pack may be provided thus: \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 9(1)(b)5 of the Trade Marks Act \n \n27. \nThe use of the Swiss \n insignia, along with the words \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘, submits Mr Anand, would serve in trade to \ndesignate the goods as being of Swiss geographical origin.  The mark \nis, therefore, ex facie non registrable under Section 9(1)(b)5, which \n                                          \n8 144.  \nTrade usages, etc., to be taken into consideration. – In any proceeding relating to a trade mark, \nthe Registrar or the High Court, as the case may be, shall admit evidence of the usages of the trade concerned \nand of any relevant trade mark or trade name or get up legitimately used by other persons. \n9 (2015) 64 PTC 559 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 13 of 79 \n \n \nproscribes registration of marks which ―consist exclusively of marks \nor indications which may serve in trade to designate‖, inter alia, \n―geographical origin ... of the goods‖. \n \n28. \nMr Anand has, in this context, also relied on the Manual of \nTrade Marks Practice and Procedure by the Ministry of Commerce \nand Industries which contains the guidelines followed by the Registry \nin the matter of registration of trade marks.  The following guidelines, \nto be found with respect to registration of trade marks which indicate \nthe geographical origin of the goods, are cited: \n \n― ―Geographical origin” \n \nName of places with populations of less than 5000 in India prima \nfacie be acceptable.  However if the location covers a large area \nhaving a reputation in the goods or service, the application may \nattract objections. \n \n– In the case of overseas names, location is considered more \nimportant than size. \n \n– In the case of Industrialised countries such as USA, Japan or \nEurope, while population size of 100,000 for reasonable for \nacceptability, it is to be borne in mind if the location has a \nreputation or services, the size of the location of its remoteness \nwill not help acceptability of the geographical name as a \ntrademark. \n \n***** \n \nGeographical names used fancifully \n \nGeographical names, used in a fanciful manner such as NORTH \nPOLE or MOUNT EVEREST for banana, which are not likely to \nbe indicating the origin of the goods, can be accepted. \n \nNames of rivers, seas and deserts etc. \n \n***** \n \nWhere the geographical location covers a large area (even if \nsparsely populated) and/or reputation in the goods, the application \nwill face an objection. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 14 of 79 \n \n \n***** \n \nNames of suburbs of big cities \n \nIn India many suburbs of Mumbai such as Andheri, Borivali or \nBhendi Bazar etc., are as large and well-known as many towns.  \nThey should be considered as a town per se with comparable \npopulation figures.  In the case of an application to register the \nname of district of Mumbai, Examiners should consider whether \nthe name is likely to be seen as fanciful use of the name or as a \nplausible indication of geographical origin.‖ \n \nMr. Anand submits that, as Switzerland is a large country with a \npopulation of almost 1 crore, the word ―Swiss‖ is unregisterable as a \ntrade mark under the Trade Marks Act.  He has placed reliance, in this \ncontext, on the decision of the High Court of Calcutta in Imperial \nTobacco of India v Registrar of Trademarks10, which holds ―Simla‖ \nto be unregisterable as a trade mark.   \n \nSection 9(2)(a)6 of the Trade Marks Act \n \n29. \nSection 9(2)(a)6, submits Mr. Anand, is also breached by the \nimpugned mark, as the use of the impugned mark would deceive and \nconfuse the public into believing that the goods bearing the impugned \nmark are of Swiss origin or bear an association with the Swiss Army \nor Switzerland, whereas, in fact, the goods are of Chinese origin and \nhave no connection with Switzerland whatsoever.  Likelihood of \nconfusion or deception would suffice to attract this clause, submits \nMr. Anand; actual confusion or deception need not be shown.  \nDistinguishing between ―confusion‖ and ―deception‖, Mr. Anand \nsubmits that if the customer is in a stage of wonderment as to the \nexistence of a connection, it indicates ―confusion‖, whereas, if he, \nacting on the basis of the confused impression that is conveyed, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 15 of 79 \n \n \nproceeds to make a purchase, he is ―deceived‖.

Sentino Bio Products Pvt. Ltd.12 and the \ndecision of the House of Lords in Parker-Knoll Ltd. v. Knoll \nInternational Ltd.13.  Likelihood of confusion, submits Mr. Anand, \nrelying on Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah14, is all that is \nrequired to disentitle the mark to registration; not actual confusion.  In \nthis context, Mr. Anand submits that the onus is always on the \napplicant seeking registration of its mark to establish the existence of a \ngeographical connect between the goods on which the mark is used \nand the location to which the mark adverts, for which he relies on para \n6 of Amritdhara Pharmacy v Satya Deo Gupta15 and In Re Dunn's \nTrade-marks.16.  \n \n30. \nOn the aspect of likelihood of confusion or deception, paras 27 \nto 29 of the impugned order read thus: \n―27. \nNow, if we see the impugned trademark in the Indian \ncontext, the defense forces in India – be it – the army or military, \nair force or navy, all are held in high respect as performing the \nsovereign function to protect and defend the territorial sovereignty \nand integrity of the country. They are never regarded as entities \ninvolved in commercial activities and doing trade or business in \nthe impugned goods i.e. textile items,and for the purpose having or \nusing trade or business marks. Therefore, to my mind, the adoption \nof the impugned trademark by the applicant in India in respect of \nthe impugned goods is only arbitrary and fanciful and can’t be \nsaid to be non-distinctive or descriptive of geographical origin of \ngoods or termed as a false trade description or amounting to false \nswiss designation or said to be malafide with a view to confuse or \nmislead the consumers in India to think that the impugned goods \n                                                                                                                   \n10 AIR 1977 Cal 413 \n11 221 (2015) DLT 359 (DB) : (2015) 63 PTC 551 (DB) \n12 2014 SCC OnLine Del 3423 \n13 1962 RPC 265 \n14 (2002) 3 SCC 65 \n15 (1963) 2 SCR 484  \n16 [L.R.] 41 Ch.D. 439 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 16 of 79 \n \n \noriginate from the opponent or from the Swiss military or from \nSwitzwerland and thereby causing confusion and/or deception \namongst the consumers and tricking them to buy those goods. To \nmy mind, the impugned trademark is fairly capable of \ndistinguishing the applicant‘s goods from those of others including \nthe opponent in India. The contentions of the opponent to the \ncontrary are accordingly rejected.  \n \n28. \nFurther, given the fact that there is no cogent evidence by \nthe opponent on record to show any use of SWISS MILITARY as a \ntrademark in the course of trade in India in respect of the \nimpugned goods or in respect of goods of the same description or \nin respect of any, allied or cognate goods, or to show .any \nreputation or goodwill enjoyed by SWISS MILITARY as a \ntrademark in the course of trade of any such goods in India or of \nany transborder reputation therein trickling or being recognized in \nIndia in respect of any goods, the adoption of the impugned \ntrademark by the applicant in India can’t be said to be malafide or \nin bad faith done to usurp any reputation or goodwill of the \nopponent or of the swiss defense forces in the trademark SWISS \nMILITARY or to pass off its goods as those originating or coming \nfrom the opponent or from the Swiss military or from Switzerland. \n \n29. \nThus, the adoption of the impugned trademarks by the \napplicant in India seems fairly honest and independent of the \nopponent or of any goodwill or reputation of the opponent or of the \nSwiss defense forces including the Swiss military in respect of \nSWISS MILITARY as a trademark or as Swiss designation.‖ \n(Emphasis supplied) \n \nMr. Anand submits that the finding of the learned Deputy Registrar, \nthat people would not assume, from the impugned mark, that the \ngoods on which the mark was affixed were of Swiss Origin, was no \nmore than his ipse dixit.  No basis for the finding is forthcoming in the \nimpugned order. \n \nSection 11(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Act read with the Geneva \nConventions Act, 1960, the (Swiss) Federal Act on the Protection of \nTrade Marks and Indications of Source, the (Swiss) Ordinance On The \nRegister Of Appellations Of Origin and Geographical Indications for \nNon-Agricultural Products Regulations and the Paris Convention for \nthe protection of the Industrial Property \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 17 of 79 \n \n \n31. \nMr. Anand next trains his sights on Section 11(3)(a) of the \nTrade Marks Act, juxtaposed with various other statutory provisions, \nIndian as well as foreign.  \n \n32. \nAt this juncture itself, I deem it appropriate to observe that the \nwords ―by virtue of any law‖, employed in Section 11(3)(a), \nhowsoever widely construed, cannot embrace laws enacted in foreign \njurisdictions, which have not been made specifically enforceable in \nIndia in a manner known to law.  The expression ―any law‖ has, \ntherefore, to be understood as referring to laws in force in India, and \nnot laws in force anywhere in the world.  Else, the learned Deputy \nRegistrar would have to conduct global checks of all laws in force \nacross the world before registering a mark.  That, quite obviously, \ncannot be the intent of Section 11(3)(a).   \n \n33. \nI do not, therefore, intend to refer to the the (Swiss) Federal Act \non the Protection of Trade Marks and Indications of Source, the \n(Swiss) Ordinance On The Register Of Appellations Of Origin and \nGeographical Indications for Non-Agricultural Products Regulations, \nwhich are laws in force in Switzerland with no extra-territorial \napplication extending to India.   \n \n34. \nSection 11(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Act prohibits registration \nof a trademark if its use in India is liable to be prevented ―by virtue of \nany law in particular the law of passing off protecting an unregistered \ntrade mark used in the course of trade‖.

These provision, he submits, clearly prohibit use of the \nred and white cross, being the heraldic emblem of Switzerland, \nby any person for any purpose. He submits that the impugned \norder has dismissed this contention by merely observing that, in \nthe application submitted by Respondent 2, the mark was in the \nform of a white cross on a black background, and not a white \ncross on a red background. Mr. Anand submits that the \nimpugned order, thereby, ignores the actual mark which was \nbeing used by Respondent 2. \n \n(ii) \nIn this context, Mr. Anand invites my attention to the 13th \nLok Sabha debates at the time of tabling of the Trade Marks \nBill 1999. The 13th Loksabha Debates, with respect to Clause \n11(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Bill, which was later enacted as \nSection 11(3)(a) in the Trade Marks Act, recommended as \nunder: \n―Regarding the clause 11(3)(a) providing for a relative \nground of refusal of registration by virtue of law of \ncopyright should be further elaborated so as to protect \nIndia‘s commitments under the Universal and the Berne \nCopyright Conventions as endorsed by Parliament in the \nInternational Copyright Order 1991 as also its obligations \nunder the TRIPS Agreement of the GATT.‖ \n(Emphasis supplied) \n                                          \n17 12. \nProhibition of use of Red Cross and other emblems. – No person shall, without the approval of \nthe Central Government, use for any purpose whatsoever –  \n***** \n \n(d) \nthe emblem of a white or silver cross with vertical and horizontal arms of the same length \non, and completely surrounded by, a red ground, being the heraldic emblem of the Swiss \nConfederation; or \n \n(e) \nany design or wording so nearly resembling any of the emblems or designations specified \nin the preceding clauses of this section so as to be capable of being mistaken for, or, as the case may \nbe, understood as referring to, one of those emblems.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 19 of 79 \n \n \n  \nThe binding nature of India commitements under the Universal \nand the Berne Copyright Convention was, therefore, submits \nMr. Anand, recognized even in the Lok Sabha debates which \npreceded the enactment of the Trade Marks Act in 1999.   \n \n(iii) \nMr. Anand next refers to Clause (1)(a) in Article 6ter18 of \nthe Paris Convention for the Protection of the Industrial \nProperty (herein after ―the Paris Convention‖), which, he \nsubmits, is binding on India, as  India was a member country of \nthe Convention. The impugned mark, points out Mr. Anand, \nclearly violates Article 6ter(1)(a) of the Paris Convention, as it \nrepresents the flag of the Swiss Confederation. \n \n(iv) \nTo buttress these contentions, Mr. Anand also invokes \nSection 57(8)19 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (―the \nEvidence Act‖), which requires Courts to take judicial notice of \nthe national flag or States or Sovereigns recognized by the \nGovernment of India.   \n \n35. \nMr. Anand submits that the impugned order does not deal with \nthe submissions of the appellant at all. Paras 30 to 47 of the impugned \norder, which address these submissions, read thus: \n“30. \nThe opponent has vehemently pressed that the impugned \ntrademark is prohibited under Article 6ter and l0bis the Paris of \n                                          \n18(1)(a) The countries of the Union agree to refuse or to invalidate the registration, and to prohibit by \nappropriate measures the use, without authorization by the competent authorities, either as trademarks or as \nelements of trademarks, of armorial bearings, flags, and other State emblems, of the countries of the Union, \nofficial signs and hallmarks indicating control and warranty adopted by them, and any imitation from a \nheraldic point of view. \n \n19 57.  \nFacts of which Court must take judicial notice. – The Court shall take judicial notice of the \nfollowing facts: \n***** \n(8) \nThe existence, title, and national flag of every State or Sovereign recognized by the \nGovernment of India: \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 20 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 20 of 79 \n \n \nConvention for Protection of Industrial Property. Additionally, the \nLd. Counsel for the opponent has, during the hearing, contended \nthat the impugned trademark is barred by the provisions of Article \n22. \n \n31. \nAt the outset, it is to be borne in mind that India is a \nsovereign country governed by its own laws. The registration of \ntrademerks in India is governed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and \nrules framed thereunder. Therefore, the validity and entitlement of \nthe impugned trademark for registration is to be tried and tested in \naccordance with the provisions of the Trade Marks Act and rules. \n \n32. \nThe Trade Marks Act and rules do not provide for any \nobjection to any application for registration af a trademark on \nground that it violates the provisions of the Paris Convention or \nTRIPS. However, as an obligation of the Country towards \ninternational conventions. I deem it fit to consider the said \nobjection raised by the opponent. \n \n***** \n \n35. \nFurther, the registration and protection of geographical \nindication in India is governed by the Geographical Indications \n(Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 and rules framed \nthereunder. Any geographical indications to have statutory \nprotection from unauthorized use are to be registered under the GI \nlaw of India. \n \n36. \nAs already stated earlier, India is a sovereign country \ngoverned by its own laws. Even it is accepted for a moment that \nthe impugned mark is a Swiss appellation/geographical indication \nunder Swiss laws, the same is of no effect as the Swiss laws have \nno force and applicability within India and from my personal \nknowledge SWISS MILITARY is not registered as a geographical \nindication in India under the provisions of the Geographical \nIndication (Registration and Protection) Act, 2002. \n \n37. \nThus, Article 22 of the TRIPS relating to protection of \ngeographical indication has no applicability to the present matter. \nThe contention of the opponent is accordingly rejected. \n \n38. \nFurther, given that SWISS MILITARY is not a registered \ngeographical indication in India, I also reject the contention of the \nopponent that the impugned trademark amounts to falsely applying \nthe \ntrademark \ninvolving \na \nwrongful \nindication \nof \nsource/appellation/geographical indication, therefore, barred by the \nprovisions of Sections 102, 103 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. \n \n39. \nNow, Article 6ter of the Paris Convention contains \nprohibitions concerning use, without authorization by the \ncompetent authorities, either as a trademark or as elements of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 21 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 21 of 79 \n \n \ntrademarks, of armorial bearing, flags, and other State emblems, of \nthe countries of the Union, official signs and hallmarks indicating \ncontrol and warranty adopted by them, and any imitation from a \nheraldic point of view. \n \n40. \nThe opponent contends that the Swiss emblem of Swiss \nCross comprising of a white cross with vertical and horizontal arms \nof the same length on, and completely surrounded by, a red ground, \nis a heraldic emblem of the Swiss confederation. The impugned \ntrademark comprising white cross on a black background is \nidentical/substantially similar to/slavish imitation of the said Swiss \nemblem, therefore, prohibited under Article 6ter of the Paris \nConvention. \n \n41. \nIn order to appreciate the above contention raised by the \nopponent, the Swiss emblem and the impugned trademark are \nreproduced as under – \n \n \n \n42. \nAs could be seen, the Swiss emblem of Swiss Cross \ncomprises of a white cross completely surounded by a red ground \nin square shape. The vertical and horizontal arms of the cross are of \nthe same length and width. On the other hand, the impugned \ntrademark is a composite label in black and white color scheme. It \ncomprises of a device of white cross surrounded by a black ground \nin square shape with rounded corners and underneath the word \nSWISS followed by the word MILITARY below it as prominent \nand essential feature of the mark. The vertical and horizontal arms \nof the cross used in the impugned trademark do not appear to be of \nthe same length and width. Even if one compares the device of \ncross in the impugned trademark with the Cross in the Swis \nemblem, the Swiss Cross has a particular symmetry and colour \nscheme which is completely different from the device of cross in \nthe impugned trademark which is white in colour surrounded by \nblack ground in square shape with rounded corners. Thus, not only \nafter thoughtful consideration and comparison of two marks as a \nwhole but also in the first impression, the two marks appear \ndifferent from each other. The Ld. Consel for the opponent has \nargued that in case the impugned trademarks in registered in black \nand white, as per section 10 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, it would \nbe deemed to be registered for all colors, therefore, color of the \nimpugned trademark is not of much significance for the purpose of \ncomparison of the marks. I do agree with the Ld. Counsel for the \nopponent to the extent he says that as per section 10, a mark if \nregistered in black and white colour would be deemed to be \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 22 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 22 of 79 \n \n \nregistered for all colors, however, it doesn‘t naturally follow from \nthis that the mark would be deemed to be registered in every \npossible color scheme/combination of colors including the color \nscheme/combination of colors of the Swiss emblem. Thus, to my \nmind, the contention of the opponent that the impugned trademark \ncomprising \nwhite \ncross \non \na \nblack \nbackground \nis \nidentical/substantially similar to/slavish imitation of the Swiss \nemblem of Swiss Cross, therefore, prohibited under Article 6ter of \nthe Paris Convention doesn‘t hold good and is liable to be rejected. \n \n***** \n45. \nAnother contention of the opponent as argued by the Ld. \nCounsel is that the registration of the impugned trademark is barred \nby the provisions of Section 12(a), (d) and (e) of the Geneva \nConventions Act, 1960, respectively, prohibiting use of Red Cross \nor Geneva Cross, the Swiss emblems as well as any design or \nwording so nearly resembling to said designations or emblem as to \nbe capable of being mistaken for or as referring to them. \n \n46. \nIn order to appreciate the above contention raised by the \nopponent, the Swiss emblem, the Red Cross or the Geneva Cross \nand the impugned trademark are reproduced herein below – \n \n \n \n47. \nHaving already held that the impugned trademark is \ndifferent from the Swiss emblem of the Swiss Cross, for the same \nreasons, I hold that the impugned trademark as a whole as well as \nthe device of white cross on black ground therein even separately, \nare different from the ‗RED CROSS‘ or ‗GENEVA CROSS‘. \nTherefore, the provisions of Section 12(a), (d) and (e) of the \nGeneva Conventions Act, 1960 have no applicability in the present \nmatter.‖ \n \nMr. Anand submits that these findings are totally unsustainable in \nlaw, for the reasons already cited supra. \n \nSubmissions of Mr. Akhil Sibal on behalf of Respondent 2 \n \n36. \nResponding to the submissions of Mr. Anand, Mr. Sibal \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 23 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 23 of 79 \n \n \nsubmits that the respondent is the prior user of the impugned mark \nand is using the mark since 1989, continuously.  As against this, it is \npointed out that the appellant has no registered trademark, similar to \nthe impugned article, in India.  All applications of the appellant, for \nregistration of the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ marks, it is pointed out, are \non ―proposed to be used‖ basis, and are pending with the Registry of \nTrade Marks.  Besides, points out Mr. Sibal, all applications, \nincluding the international application filed by the appellant, have \nbeen filed after the registration of the impugned marks in favour of \nRespondent 2 in India.   \n \n37. \nMr. Sibal also advances a preliminary objection to the reliance, \nby Mr. Anand, on promotional or advertising material to contend that \nRespondent 2 was promoting its goods, bearing the impugned mark, \nin such a fashion as to lure consumers into drawing an association \nbetween the goods and Switzerland, by, for example, showing the \nSwiss Alps in the background, or the Swiss flag in the foreground.  \nHe submits that this Court is presently hearing an appeal against an \norder allowing registration of the impugned mark and declining the \nobjections of the appellant against such registration.  The manner in \nwhich the marks are used, he submits, is not a factor which is \nrelevant in this regard.  Registration of a mark, he submits, cannot be \nallowed or refused depending on the manner in which the applicant \nfor registration is making use of the marks.   \n \nRe. Sections 2(1)(i)(I) and 2(1)(i)(IV)(a) of the Trade Marks Act \n \n38. \nMr. Sibal refutes the allegation of Mr. Anand that the \nimpugned mark amounts to a ―false trade description‖ within the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 24 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 24 of 79 \n \n \nmeaning of Section 2(1)(i)(I)  of the Trade Marks Act.  He also draws \nattention, in this context, to the definition of ―trade description‖ as \ncontained in Section 2(1)(za)(iv)20.  In view of these definitions, Mr. \nSibal submits that the impugned mark, i.e. \n, must inherently and \nunequivocally indicate, to the customer, that the goods, on which the \nmark figures, were made in Switzerland.  The finding to the contrary, \nin the impugned order is, he submits, unexceptionable.  Even if the \nimpugned mark were to suggest some possible Swiss connection, he \nsubmits that it does not indicate, in any manner, that the goods were \nmade in Switzerland.  Inasmuch as Section 9 contains absolute \ngrounds for refusing registration, its provisions have to be strictly \nconstrued.  He submits that it would be unrealistic to presume that \nthe consuming public would, because of the use of the impugned \nmarks by Respondent 2, deem the goods, on which they are used, to \nemanate from the Swiss defence forces.  The aspect of ―false trade \ndescription‖, he submits, has to be examined from the perspsective of \nan Indian consumer of average intelligence.  He echoes the \nobservation, in the impugned order, that defence forces, of any \ncountry, are held in high esteem and respect and submits, therefore, \nthat the general public would never accept the fact that the armed \nforces of Switzerland would be engaged in trading or business \nactivities.  If Mr. Anand‘s submissions were to be accepted, Mr. \nSibal submits that marks such as ‗PETER ENGLAND‘ and \n‗AMERICAN TOURISTER‘ would become unregisterable.   \n \n                                          \n20 (za)  \n―trade description‖ means any description, statement or other indication, direct or indirect, -  \n***** \n(iv)  \nas to the place or country in which or the time at which any goods or services were made, \nproduced or provided, as the case may be;  \n \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 25 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 25 of 79 \n \n \n39. \nBesides, submits Mr. Sibal, the impugned mark could be \nregarded as a ―false trade description‖ only if, inherently and per se, \nthe mark, represented that the goods on that which it is affixed were \nmanufactured in Switzerland.  No material to so suggest, he submits, \nis forthcoming, especially apropos textiles, with respect to which \nregistration has been granted to the impugned mark.   \n \n40. \nWithout prejudice, Mr. Sibal submits that there does, in fact, \nexist a connect between the impugned mark and Switzerland, as (i) \nRespondent 2 is based in Switzerland, (ii) the mark was initially \nadopted by the Boegli family, which was based in Switzerland, who \nlater assigned rights in respect of the mark to Respondent 2 vide \nassignment deed dated 13th December 2014, (iii) Ashok Sawhney, the \nNon-Executive Director of Respondent 2 started his career in \nSwitzerland and (iv) refills, for the goods or Respondent 2, were \nmanufactured in Switzerland. \n \n41. \nIn any case, submits Mr. Sibal, even if the impugned mark \nwere to amount to a ―false trade description‖, that does not constitute \na ground to refuse it registration either under Section 9 or Section 11.  \nThe consequences of registration of a mark which is a false trade \ndescription, he points out, are to be found in Sections 1034 and 10421 \n                                          \n21 104.  \nPenalty for selling goods or providing services to which false trade mark or false trade \ndescription is applied. – Any person who sells, lets for hire or exposes for sale, or hires or has in his \npossession for sale, goods or things, or provides or hires services, to which any false trade mark or false trade \ndescription is applied or which, being required under Section 139 to have applied to them an indication of the \ncountry or place in which they were made or produced or the name and address of the manufacturer, or \nperson for whom the goods are manufactured or services provided, as the case may be, are without the \nindications so required, shall, unless he proves,— \n(a)  \nthat, having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence against this \nsection, he had at the time of commission of the alleged offence no reason to suspect the \ngenuineness of the trade mark or trade description or that any offence had been committed in \nrespect of the goods or services; or \n(b)  \nthat, on demand by or on behalf of the prosecutor, he gave all the information in his \npower with respect to the person from whom he obtained such goods or things or services; or \n(c)  \nthat otherwise he had acted innocently, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 26 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 26 of 79 \n \n \nof the Trade Marks Act.   \n \nRe. Section 9(1)(b)5 \n \n42. \nMr. Sibal would contend that the appellant is estopped from \ninvoking Section 9(1)(b)5, as it has itself applied for registration of \nthe word mark ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ and the device mark \n.  He submits that Section 9(1)(b)5 engrafts an absolute \nproscription against registration, which is not dependent on the \nidentity of the applicant.  He relies, for this purpose, on Indian \nHotels Co. Ltd v. Jiva Institute of Vedic Science & Culture22. \n \n43. \nOn merits, Mr. Sibal emphasises the word ―exclusively‖, \nfiguring in Section 9(1)(b)5.  He submits that the proscription in \nSection 9(1)(b)5 applies only to marks which ―consist exclusively of \nmarks or indications which may serve in trade‖ to designate the \ngeographical origin of the goods.    The impugned mark, he submits, \ndoes not consist exclusively of marks or indications whch designate \nthe geographical origin of the goods on which it is used, as it is a \ncomposite mark with a black and white cross and the words ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘.  He submits that the appellant has led no evidence to \nestablish that the red and white cross (\n) or the words ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ serve in trade, in India, to designate the geographical \norigin of textiles, on which they are used.  The impugned order, \ntherefore, is correct in holding that they are fanciful when used in \nrelation to textiles.  Additionally, as the grant of registration to the \n                                                                                                                   \nbe punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to \nthree years and with fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend to two lakh \nrupees \n22 2008 SCC OnLine Del 1758 : (2008) 37 PTC 468 (DB) \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 27 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 27 of 79 \n \n \nimpugned device mark  \n is subject to the disclaimer that no \nexclusivity would be claimed in respect either of the black and white \ncross or of the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ phrase that figures below it, \nSection 9(1)(b) would not apply.   \n \n44. \nIn this context, Mr. Sibal also invites attention to Section \n11(2)(a)23 of the Georgaphical Indications of Goods (Registration and \nProtection) Act, 1999 (―the GI Act‖).  The restraints and restrictions \nto which Mr. Anand alludes, submits Mr. Sibal, would apply only to \nan application for registration under Section 11(1) of the GI Act, and \nnot to an application under the Trade Marks Act.   \n \n45. \nMr. Sibal also relies on an order dated 5th December 2019 of \nthe Higher Regional Court at Hamburg which holds that the cross-\nshaped logo was not invariably associated with goods produced in \nSwitzerland.  The test, he reiterates, has to be that of the perception \nof the average consumer, who would not, by the mere use of the \nimpugned mark, be drawn to presume that the goods on which they \nfind place originated in Switzerland.   Mr. Sibal also cites, in this \ncontext, a judgement of the High Court of Gujarat in Sahkar Seeds \nCorpn. v.

Section 9(2)(a)6 \n \n46. \nSection 9(2)(a)6, too, is not available to the appellant, \naccording to Mr. Sibal, as the appellant‘s own licensees are using the \nmarks ‗Wenger‘ (\n)and ‗Swiss Gear‘ (\n) with a \nwhite cross on a red background (in relation to goods not \nmanufactured in Switzerland, but in China, Hong Kong, etc, for \nwhich he has relied upon promotional material available on the \ninternet.  From the same material, Mr. Sibal points out that Wenger \nwas taken over by the Victorinox group in 2005 and that Swiss Gear \nwas owned by Wenger.  He has, in context, referred to the Affidavit \nfiled by the appellant before the learned Deputy Registrar of Trade \nMarks in support of its opposition to the application of Respondent 2 \nin which it is affirmed that the Swiss Governmente and Victorinox \nhad concluded a licence agreement which allowed Victorinox to use \nthe trade marks ‗SWISS ARMY‘ or ‗SWISS MILITARY‘.    \n \n47. \nOn merits, Mr. Sibal submits that Section 9(2)(a) would apply \nonly where the mark, by its very nature, is confusing or deceptive.  \nGiven the principle of territoriality that attaches to trade marks – for \nwhich he cites Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisa v. Prius Auto \nIndustries Ltd25 – Mr. Sibal contends that the likelihood of deception \nor confusion has to be assessed on the basis of the inherent nature of \nthe mark; not its use, and has to be tested in the Indian context \n                                          \n25 (2018) 2 SCC 1 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 29 of 79 \n \n \nkeeping in mind the class of consumers who would purchase the \ngoods in India.

The appellant, he \npoints out, has not cited any example of actual confusion having so \narisen.  The impugned mark cannot, he submits, be compared, for \nexample, with a mark like ‗SWISS MADE‘, which would \nunequivocally point to the goods having been made in Switzerland.   \n \n48. \nThe findings, in the impugned order, on this issue, he submits \nare not, therefore, perverse, as would justify interference by this \nCourt.    \n \nRe. Section 11(3)(a) – the Paris Convention, the Geneva Convention \nand the Geneva Conventions Act, 1996 \n \n49. \nAs in the case of Sections 9(1)(b) and 9(2)(a), the appellant, \nargues  Mr. Sibal, is also estopped from invoking Section 11(3)(a) of \nthe Trade Marks Act as, despite having any approval from the \nCentral Government, the appellant has itself applied for registration \nof the red and white cross device.   \n \n50. \nMr. Sibal fundamentally disagrees with Mr. Anand‘s \nunderstanding of the phrase ―any law‖ in Section 11(3)(a) of the \nTrade Marks Act.  He submits that, contextually read, the words ―any \nlaw‖ cannot be read as referring to any law in force in India, much \nless any law in force anywhere in the world.  He predicates this \nargument on the following propositions: \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 30 of 79 \n \n \n(i) \nThe words ―in particular the law of passing off \nprotecting an unregistered trade mark used in the course of \ntrade‖, as well as clause (b) of Section 11(3) which refers to \nthe ―law of copyright‖, clearly indicate that the ―law‖ that the \nphrase ―any law‖ in Section 11(3)(a) encompasses must be a \nlaw relating to intellectual property, or involving intellectual \nproperty rights.   \n \n(ii) \nSection 11(3)(a) is subject to Section 11(5)26.  Section \n11(5) ordains that a mark shall not be refused registration \nunder, inter alia, Section 11(3) unless an objection is raised in \nopposition proceedings by the proprietor of the earlier trade \nmark.  Thus, the right to object under Section 11(3) is available \nonly to the proprietor of an earlier trade mark.  The appellant \ndoes not own any earlier trade mark.  That apart, this \nspecification indicates that the words ―any law‖ employed in \nSection 11(3)(a) relates to laws impacting proprietorial rights \nin an earlier trade mark.  They cannot, therefore, be read so \nwidely as to encompass statutes such as the Geneva \nConvention Act, which has nothing whatsoever to do with \ntrade mark law.  \n \n(iii) The words ―any law‖ have to be read noscitur a sociis \nwith the law relating to passing off and ―copyright law‖.

U.O.I.29  He also relies on the decision of U.S. \nCourt of Appeals  in International Café S.A.L. v. Hard Rock Café \nInternational Inc.30 which holds that the Paris Convention is not \nself-executing in nature without domestic legislation through which it \ncan be implemented.  To the same effect, he submits, is the decision \nof the U.S. Court of Appeals in Empresa Cabana del Tabaco v. \nCulbro Corporation31, which was affirmed in I.T.C. Ltd v. \nPunchgini Ltd32.  In fact, points out Mr. Sibal, though the 13th Lok \nSabha Debates advocated the elaboration of Clause 11(3)(a) of the \nTrade Marks Bill, 1999, to protect India‘s commitments under \ninternational conventions, this never happened.   \n \n52. \nAdverting next to the Geneva Convention and the Geneva \nConvention Act, Mr. Sibal submits that, unlike the Emblems and \nNames (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, which was \nspecifically incorporated by reference in the Trade Marks Act, \nmaking marks which infracted the said Act non-registerable, no \nequivalent provision with reference to the Geneva Conventions Act \nwas incorporated by the legislature. In the absence of any such \nspecific incorporation, he submits that a trade mark could not be \ndenied registration on the ground that grant thereof would violate the \n                                                                                                                   \n27 (1990) 3 SCC 447 \n28 253.  \nLegislation for giving effect to international agreements. – Notwithstanding anything in the \nforegoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament has power to make any law for the whole or any part of the \nterritory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or \nany decision made at any international conference, association or other body. \n29 (2020) 13 SCC 585 \n30 252 F. 3d. 1274 \n31 399 F. 3d. 462 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 32 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 32 of 79 \n \n \nGeneva Conventions Act.  \n \n53. \nSection 12 of the Geneva Conventions Act, submits Mr. Sibal, \nis, moreover, not directed towards use of trade marks in particular.  \nArticle 53 of the 1st Geneva Convention, on the other hand, \nspecifically refers to use of trade marks; however, Article 53 has not \nbeen made enforceable by the Geneva Conventions Act or by any \nother statute.  Mr. Sibal relies, in this context, on Sections 2(a)33, \n3(1)34 and 3(3)(a)35 of the Geneva Conventions Act.  Conjointly read, \nhe submits, it becomes clear that, of the various Articles in the Ist \nSchedule to the Geneva Conventions Act, Article 50 alone has been \nmade enforceable.  Article 53 is not, therefore, enforceable at law.  \nAdverting to Section 12, Mr. Sibal submits that the Section does not \nincorporate an absolute prohibition, as use of the white-and-red cross \nrepresenting the Swiss insignia is permissible, albeit with the \napproval of the Central Government.   \n \n54. \nMr. Sibal next specifically addresses clauses (d) and (e) of \nSection 12 of the Geneva Conventions Act.

The impugned trade \nmark, in Mr. Sibal‘s submission, is not capable of being mistaken \nwith the heraldic emblem of the Swiss confederation, especially as it \nis used with the words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘.    \n \nOrder dated 7th April 2022 of the Cancellation Division of the \nEuropean Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) \n \n55. \nIn fact, submits Mr. Sibal, all the grounds on which the \nappellant seeks rectification of the Register in the present case by \nremoval of the impugned mark therefrom, were raised by the \nappellant before the Cancellation Division of the EUIPO, and \ndiscredited by the EUIPO vide order dated 7th April 2022, against \nwhich the appellant has not appealed.  The mark under challenge in \nthat case was ‗SWISS MILITARY by PSM‘, but the use of the words \n―by PSM‖, he submits, would make no difference to the ratio of the \nsaid decision.

Section 144 of the Trade Marks Act \n \n56. \nThe reference to ―trade usage‖ in Section 1448 of the Trade \nMarks Act, submits Mr. Sibal, is intended to ascertain whether, \nowing to usage of the mark by other persons, it has become common \nto the trade, generic or wanting in distinctiveness.

No evidence of trade usage of the impugned mark in \nIndia, he submits, has been provided by the appellant. The \njudgements, on which Mr. Anand relies in this context, he submits, \nwere rendered in the context of infringement claims, or relative \ngrounds for refusal of registration, and not in the context of the \nabsolute grounds envisaged by Section 9.  Besides, as the application \nof Respondent 1 was on a ―proposed to be used‖ basis, prior usage \nbecame irrelevant.   \n \nRe. allegation of fabrication of invoices \n \n57. \nMr. Sibal, closing his submissions, addressed the allegation of \nMr. Anand that Respondent 2 had relied on a fabricated invoice in \nsupport of its application seeking registration of the impugned mark.  \nHe points out that the allegation is predicated solely on the reference, \nin the said invoice, to the ₹ symbol to denote the Indian Rupee, \nallegedly before the symbol had been officially notified by the \nGovernment.  He first submits that no such contention was ever \nadvanced by the appellant before the learned Deputy Registrar of \nTrade Marks in support of its opposition and cannot, therefore, be \nraised by the appellant for the first time in the present appeal.  It is \nfor this reason, points out Mr. Sibal, that the impugned order returns \nno finding on this aspect.  In any event, as the application for \nregistration of the mark, by the respondent, was on a ―proposed to be \nused‖ basis, this aspect was irrelevant.  He clarifies that the use of the \n₹ symbol was only due to the software used by his client.  In any \nevent, he points out that, apart from the said invoice, Respondent 1 \nhad filed several other invoices to evidence sale of the products using \nthe impugned mark during the period 2015 to 2017, apart from sales \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 35 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 35 of 79 \n \n \nfigures certified by the Chartered Accountant.   \n \n58. \nWhere, thus, the application for registration of the mark is not \nsusceptible to rejection either under Section 9 or under Section 11 of \nthe Trade Marks Act, Mr. Sibal submits that its registration is \nmandatory, and no discretion vests with the learned Deputy Registrar \nin that regard.   \n \nMr. Anand‘s submissions in rejoinder \n \n59. \nMr. Anand submits, first, in rejoinder, that the EUIPO order \ndated 7th April 2022 would not apply because, unlike the law that \napplied in that case, under the Trade Marks Act in India, the onus to \nprove that the impugned mark does not create confusion or deception \nis on the applicant seeking its registration, whereas the onus to prove \nthat a mark infringes an existing mark is on the plaintiff alleging \ninfringement.  He underscores the finding, of the EUIPO, that \n―potential deception unconnected to the quality of the goods/services \nprovided under the mark, and which does not impact consumer \nprotection, cannot lead to deceit under Article 7(1)(g) EUTMR‖.  The \nposition in Indian law, he points out, is different, as the test is \n―likelihood‖ to result in confusion or deception, not actual deceit. \nBesides, in that case, the impugned mark was ‗SWISS MILITARY \nBY PSM‘, which was different from the impugned mark in the \npresent case.  Again, the impugned mark in the EUIPO order did not \nmake use of the cross, unlike the impugned mark before this Court.  \nDrawing attention to the findings in the EUIPO order, Mr. Anand \npoints out that the EUIPO, in that case, specifically held that  ―the \nexpression ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ in conjunction with ‗BY PSM‘ \nrules out any connection to the Swiss Army or Swiss military \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 36 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 36 of 79 \n \n \nstandards.‖  Mr. Anand also points out that the EUIPO order does not \nconsider the effect of the Geneva Convention Act, which applies only \nto India.   \n \n60. \nFor the proposition that the manner of use, by Respondent 1, of \nthe impugned mark was also relevant, Mr. Anand relies on \nAmritdhara Pharmacy15, Louis Vitton Malletier9 and the judgement \nof the Queens Bench of the Court of Appeal in Specsavers \nInternational Healthcare Ltd v Asda Stores Ltd36.   \n \n61. \nApropos Section 9(2)(a)6, Mr. Anand submits that deception or \nconfusion could arise for any reason, which might or might not have \nany element of comparison with another mark.  Switzerland being a \nwell known confederacy, Mr. Anand submits that there is every \nlikelihood of an unwary consumer in India linking the goods, on \nwhich the impugned \n is to be found, with Switzerland.  Mr. \nAnand once again invokes, for this purpose, Section 57(8)19 of the \nEvidence Act.  The Court, in such cases, submits Mr. Anand, is \nrequired to envisage a market place and visualize what would happen \nif the goods, bearing the impugned mark, were sought to be sold \nthere. \n \n62. \nThe principle of territoriality, submits Mr. Anand, would not \napply in a case such as this.  He seeks to distinguish Toyota Jidosha \nKabushiki Kaisa25 on the ground that, in that case, the defendant \ndisclaimed all knowledge whereas, in the present, Respondent 1 has \nitself promoted the impugned mark in a manner to create an obvious \nassociation with Switzerland and also sought a licence from the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 37 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 37 of 79 \n \n \nappellant.   \n \n63. \nApropos Mr. Sibal‘s submission that the appellant‘s licencees \nwere using a white cross on a red background as a logo for goods \nmanufactured in China, Mr. Anand submits that this material was \nnever cited before the learned Deputy Registrar and does not, \ntherefore, form any part of the impugned order. \n \nMr. Sibal in surrejoinder \n \n64. \nIn surrejoinder, besides reiterating the submissions already \nadvanced by him earlier, Mr. Sibal submits, with regard to Mr. \nAnand‘s repeated emphasis on the fact that Respondent 1 had sought \na licence from the appellant, that the licence was sought for \ntimepieces, with which Switzerland has an indelible association and \nreputation.  The goods under consideration in the present case, per \ncontra, he submits, are textiles.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nA Preliminary Observation \n \n65. \nThe right to have a trade mark registered is a valuable \ncommercial right.  Registration confers manifold rights and \nprivileges under the Trade Marks Act.  These rights and privileges \noperate in rem and against the whole world.37  They are non-\nnegotiable.  Registration of a trade mark not only confers valuable \nbrand value and goodwill, thereby promoting the goods and their \n                                                                                                                   \n36 [2012] EWCA Civ 24 \n37 Refer Vidya Drolia v.

The right to registration must, therefore, be sedulously \nguarded.  Any provision which abrogates, or even curtails, the right \nto registration of a mark as a trade mark has, therefore, to be strictly \nconstrued.  The right of registration to a mark cannot be denied on \nfanciful apprehensions.   \n \n66. \nOn the flip side, the Court is also required to be mindful of the \nproscriptions statutorily engrafted in Sections 9 and 11 of the Trade \nMarks Act.  Where a mark is statutorily non-registerable under the \nsaid provisions, the Court cannot, by interpretative calisthenics, \ncompel the Registrar to register it.  The prohibitions against \nregistration, as contained in Sections 9 and 11, have a public purpose \nto serve.  They serve to counter-balance the rights of the industry and \nthe rights of the consumer public.   Confusion or deception of the \nconsumer is completely impermissible in law.  Howsoever innocent \nthe user of the confusing mark may be, no equities lie in his favour.  \nThese considerations, too, therefore, have to guide the approach of \nthe Court. \n \n67. \nThe Court is, therefore, required to strike, in such cases, a \ndelicate balance while arriving at its conclusion. \n \nI. \nIs the impugned mark a ―false trade description‖?  If so, is it \nnon-registerable? \n \n68. \nExamination of these aspects would decide the submissions of \nboth sides with respect to Sections 2(1)(i)(I) and 2(1)(za)2 as well as \n                                                                                                                   \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 39 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 39 of 79 \n \n \nSection 9(2)(a)6 of the Trade Marks Act. \n \n69. \nThe impugned order does not address these issues. \n \n70. \nMr. Anand submits that the impugned mark is non-\nregisterable, as it amounts to a ―false trade description‖.  Mr. Sibal, \nper contra, contends that the impugned mark is not a ―false trade \ndescription‖ and that, even if it were, it does not, by consequence, \nbecome non-registerable per se, as the consequences of registering a \nfalse trade description are to be found in Sections 1034 and 10422 of \nthe Trade Marks Act.   \n \n71. \nAre ―false trade descriptions‖ non registerable? \n \n72. \nWhere Section 2(1)(za)(iv)20 applies, the answer, to my mind, \nhas to be in the affirmative.   \n \n73. \nSection 2(1)(i) of the Trade Marks Act includes, in the \ndefinition of ―false trade description‖, ―a trade description which is \nuntrue or misleading in a material respect as regards the goods or \nservices to which it is applied‖.  The provision goes on to clarify that \ntrade marks, or parts of trade marks, could also be ―false trade \ndescriptions‖.  ―Trade description‖ is defined, in Section 2(1)(za)(iv), \nas meaning ―any description, statement or other indication, direct or \nindirect, as to the place or country in which or the time at which the \ngoods or services were made, produced or provided‖.  This includes, \nas per Section 2(1)(za), ―any … description which is likely to be \nmisunderstood or mistaken for all or any of the said matters‖.  \nAmong the ―said matters‖ is, obviously, the place or country where \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 40 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 40 of 79 \n \n \nthe goods are made.  Section 9(2)(a) absolutely prohibits registration \nof a mark if ―it is of such nature as to deceive the public or cause \nconfusion‖.  A trade description which is untrue or misleading in a \nmaterial respect regarding the goods to which is applied is a false \ntrade description.  The country of manufacture of goods is certainly a \n―material respect‖, within the meaning of Section 2(1)(i)(I).  If a \ntrade mark is untrue or misleading regarding the country of origin of \nthe goods on which it is used, there is no reason to believe that it \nwould not deceive the public or cause confusion, as the intent to \ndeceive or cause confusion can be read into the very use of the mark.  \nOne may, in this context, borrow the following well-known aphorism \nof Lindley, LJ in Slazenger & Sons v. Feltham & Co.38: \n―One must exercise one's common sense, and, if you are driven to \nthe conclusion that what is intended to be done is to deceive if \npossible, I do not think it is stretching the imagination very much \nto credit the man with occasional success or possible success. Why \nshould we be astute to say that he cannot succeed in doing that \nwhich he is straining every nerve to do?‖ \n \nAny description, statement or other indication, direct or indirect, as to \nthe country of manufacture or production of goods, contained in the \ntrade mark affixed on the goods would, therefore, be a ―false trade \ndescription‖ and, inasmuch as the mark would be of a nature which \nwould deceive the public or cause confusion, would also be ineligible \nfor registration under Section 9(2)(a).   \n \n74. \nA mark which is a ―false trade description‖ within the meaning \nof Section 2(1)(za)(iv) is, therefore, non-registerable.   \n \n75. \nIs, then, the impugned mark a ―false trade description‖ within \n                                          \n38 (1889) 6 RPC 531 \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 41 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 41 of 79 \n \n \nthe meaning of Section 2(1)(za)(iv) of the Trade Marks Act? \n \n76. \nAny description, statement, or other indication as to the place \nor country where the goods were made or produced, as contained in a \ntrade mark, would be a ―trade description‖ within the meaning of \nSection 2(1)(za).  The description may be direct or indirect.  The \ndefinition would also encompass any description which is likely to be \nmisunderstood or mistaken for an indication regarding the place or \ncountry where the goods are made or produced.   \n \n77. \nMuch turns, in my view, on the words ―direct or indirect‖.  The \nlegislature, classically, does not engage in superfluity or tautology39.  \nThe words ―direct or indirect‖ have, therefore, to be regarded as \ndeliberately included.  They connote, in the context of Section \n2(1)(za)(iv), not merely a direct, but also an indirect description, \nstatement or other indication, in the trade mark, regarding the place \nor country or manufacture or production of the goods.  If, therefore, \nthe trade mark even indirectly indicates the country of manufacture \nof the goods, it is a ―trade description‖ within the meaning of Section \n2(1)(za)(iv). \n \n78. \n―Indirect‖ is defined, in P.

The learned \nRegistrar of Trade Marks had, in that case, come to the conclusion, \nindependent of any comparison of marks or goods, that, as the mark \nof which the respondent (before the Supreme Court) desired \nregistration was likely to deceive or cause confusion, it could not be \nregistered.  The Supreme Court explained the legal position, on this \naspect, thus (in para 22 of the report): \n―22.  \nThe principles of law applicable to such cases are well \nsettled.

He is right, and I \nagree with him.  Section 9(2)(a) does not allow the Court to travel \noutside the mark itself.  The mark, by its nature, should deceive or \ncause confusion.   \n \n82. \nAt the same time, the person who should be likely to be \ndeceived or confused under Section 9(2)(a), or who may \nmisunderstand the trade description within the meaning of clause (c) \nof the inclusive part of the definition of ―trade description‖ in Section \n9(1)(za), or who may be ―misled‖ under Section 9(1)(i)(I), is a person \nof ―ordinary intelligence‖, who ―is to be taken to be reasonably well \ninformed and reasonably circumspect and observant‖.  In this context, \nthe class of consumers who are likely to purchase the goods on which \nthe mark is to be affixed is another relevant consideration, as held in \nAmritdhara Pharmacy15 and Mahendra & Mahendra Paper Mills \nLtd v. Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd46.  The goods on which the \nimpugned mark is used are generally purchased by the middle or \nupper middle class consumer in India.   \n \n83. \nThough the words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ when used either by \nthemselves or in conjunction with the red and white cross may not \nprovide any direct indication regarding the country of origin of the \ngoods as would be likely to be misunderstood or mistaken as such, \n                                          \n46 (2002) 2 SCC 147 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 45 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 45 of 79 \n \n \nwhen the words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ are used in conjunction with \nthe red-and-white cross \n, thus, any customer of average \nintelligence – which would presume knowledge of the fact that the \nred-and-white cross is the indicia of the Swiss confederation – would \nregard the mark as indicating that the goods are of Swiss origin.  The   \n mark would, therefore, be an indirect trade description regaring \nthe country where the goods, bearing the mark, are manufactured or \nproduced.  The Slazenger38 principle would also directly apply in such \na case.  Respondent 1 having used not only the white cross-on-red \nbackground indicia but also the words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ below it, \nthere is no justification for the Court to presume that the public would \nnot be compelled into believing that the goods were made or \nmanufactured in Switzerland.  The impugned mark, therefore, by its \nvery nature, has the potential to deceive or, at the very least, cause \nconfusion.   \n \n84. \nThe impugned order, in my opinion, goes completely off-\ntangent in extolling the virtues of the military establishment and \nholding, as a sequitur, that the average consumer would not regard \ngoods such as textiles as originating from the Swiss army or the Swiss \nmilitary forces, irrespective of the use of the impugned mark thereon.  \nThe virtues of the military arsenal of any country, though undeniably \nworthy of respect and reverence, have nothing whatsoever to do with \nthe controversy at hand.  Section 9(2)(a) does not expound on the \nnature of deception or confusion that it envisages.  So long as the \nmark is of such nature as to deceive or confuse, it cannot be \nregistered.

Whether the average consumer would regard the goods as \nmade or manufactured by the Swiss army, or the Swiss military \nestablishment is, therefore, irrelevant.  What has to be seen is whether \nthe average consumer – with the intellectual abilities attributed to him \nby Compass Publishing43 – would be deceived, or confused, into \nbelieving the goods to have been manufactured or produced in \nSwitzerland, not manufactured or produced by the Swiss army.   \n \n85. \n―Deception‖ and ―confusion‖ are different concepts, and, on the \ndistinction between the two, the following exordium of Lord Denning \nin Parker-Knoll Ltd v. Knoll International Ltd47 (cited, with approval \nby the Supreme Court, in, inter alia, F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. \nGeoffrey Manner & Co. Pvt Ltd48) has become locus classicus: \n―Secondly, 'to deceive' is one thing. To 'cause confusion' is \nanother. The difference is this: When you deceive a man, you tell \nhim a lie. You make a false representation to him and thereby \ncause him to believe a thing to be true which is false. You may not \ndo it knowingly, or intentionally, but still you do it, and so you \ndeceive him. But you may cause confusion without telling him a \nlie at all, and without making any false representation to him. You \nmay indeed tell him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the \ntruth, but still you may cause confusion in his mind, not by any \nfault of yours, but because he has not the knowledge or ability to \ndistinguish it from the other pieces of truth known to him or \nbecause he may not even take the trouble to do so.‖ \n \nI may usefully profit from the following clear understanding of the \ndifference between ―confusion‖ and ―deception‖, vis-à-vis use of a \n                                          \n47 1962 RPC 265 \n48 (1969) 2 SCC 716 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 47 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 47 of 79 \n \n \nmark in the course of trade, from the judgement of a Division Bench \nof this Court in Shree Nath Heritage Liquor11: \n \n―6.  \nWhen a person knows that the mark in question does not \noriginate from the senior user but the senior user is called to mind, \nthen it's a step before confusion. If on the other hand, the consumer \nis in a state of wonderment if there's a connection, this is \nconfusion. Further, if this consumer then purchases the junior users \nproduct, this is then deception.‖ \n \nThough this explanation is in the context of confusion between the \nmarks used by a ―junior‖ and a ―senior‖ user, it would hold equally \ntrue on the aspect of distinction between confusion and deception in \ngeneral.  A person is confused when he does not know which is A and \nwhich is B.  He is deceived when he is made to believe A to be B or B \nto be A.  That, plainly, is the distinction. \n \n86. \nOnce this distinction is also borne in mind, the conclusion is \nobvious.  The impugned mark, which not only uses the \n Swiss \ninsignia, but also the words ―SWISS MILITARY‖ below it, would \nclearly, at the very least, confuse the consumer of average intelligence \ninto assuming the goods to have been manufactured or produced in \nSwitzerland.  The mark would, thereby, be a ―false trade description‖ \nand be ineligible to registration within the meaning of Section \n2(1)(i)(I) as well as be rendered ineligible to registration under \nSection 9(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act. \n \n87. \nThe observations, in the impugned order, that the impugned \nmark has rounded corners, and that the arms of the cross as used in it \ndo not appear to be of the same length, fail to commend acceptance.  \nTo a person who views the mark as affixed on goods, these \ndistinctions pale into significance.

Mr. Anand has \ndrawn my attention to the actual use of the said mark, inter alia on a \nbackpack, the photograph of which is to be found in para 24 supra.  \nThe mark, as actually used, does not make apparent, to the person \nviewing the mark, any difference in the lengths of the arms of the \nwhite cross, or any roundness in the edges of the corners of the \nsquare.  In fact, para 7 of the affidavit filed by Respondent 2 in \nsupport of its application for registration acknowledges that \nRespondent 2 is the owner and proprietor ―of the said trademark/label \nwhich is duly registered in India under the Trade Mark Act, 1999‖ \nand proceeds to furnish a tabular statement of the said registration, \nwhich states that Respondent 1 holds registrations of \n(i) \nthe mark \n for key chains, \n(ii) \nthe mark \n for pens, \n(iii) the mark \n for school bags, back packs, cross bags, \nsoft luggage, travelling bags, purses, etc. and \n(iv) \nthe mark \n for leather and leather imitations, animal \nskins, hides, trunks, umbrellas, etc. \nThese marks are identical to the impugned mark.  As such, the stress, \nin the impugned order, on the ―rounded corners‖ of the impugned \nmark is really superficial.  Respondent 2 has had the same mark \nregistered separately for various classes of goods.  Mr. Sibal \nacknowledges that these registrations include registrations for the \nmark in the red-and-white colour combination.

At the cost of repetition, \nthey may once again be reproduced thus: \n―The Ld. Counsel for the opponent has argued that in case the \nimpugned trademarks is registered in black and white, as per \nsection 10 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, it would be deemed to be \nregistered for all colors, therefore, color of the impugned \ntrademark is not of much significance for the purpose of \ncomparison of the marks. I do agree with the Ld. Counsel for the \nopponent to the extent he says that as per section 10, a mark if \nregistered in black and white colour would be deemed to be \nregistered for all colors, however, it doesn’t naturally follow from \nthis that the mark would be deemed to be registered in every \npossible color scheme/combination of colors including the color \nscheme/combination of colors of the Swiss emblem.‖ \n(Emphasis supplied) \n \nTo my mind, the italicized words in the afore-extracted passage from \nthe impugned order return two mutually contradictory findings.  In the \nfirst breath, the learned Deputy Registrar agrees that the registration \nof the impugned mark without limitation of colour would deem it to \nbe registered for all colours.  In the very same breath, he goes on to \nobserve that it would not naturally follow that the mark would be \ndeemed to be registered in every possible colour scheme/combination \nof colours.  This distinction, between ―all colours‖ and ―every \npossible colour scheme/combination of colours‖, to my mind, is too \nfacile to pass legal muster.  In any event, in the present case, there is \nonly one colour involved, apart from black and white, which is red.  \nOnce, therefore, the \n mark stood registered for all colours, it also \nstands registered for use by substituting the black with a red \nbackground.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 50 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 50 of 79 \n \n \n89. \nFurther, the use, by Respondent 2, of the ―SWISS \nMILITARY‖ logo immediately below the white and red cross would \ndispel any chance of the impugned mark being distinct or \ndistinguishable from the \n Swiss insignia.  Even if the \n mark, \nwith slightly rounded corners, were to be distinguishable from the \nmark with sharp corners, the use of the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ logo \nbelow the mark would efface any impression made by that slight \ndistinction.  The \n mark, even if its corners were not as pointed, \nwhen used with the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ logo immediately below it, \nis bound, by its very nature, to create confusion in the mind of the \nordinary customer regarding the origin of the goods. To my mind, this \nis obvious.  An average consumer would be bound to presume, \nabsence conscious knowledge to the contrary, that the goods bearing \nthe \n logo are of Swiss origin, even if, arguendo, he were not to \nthink that they originated from the Swiss military establishment \nspecifically. \n \n90. \nThough it is not necessary to do so, I may also observe that the \nfinding, in the impugned order, that the average consumer would not \nassume the goods, on which the impugned mark would be affixed, to \nhave originated from the Swiss military establishment, is no more \nthan the ipse dixit of the learned Deputy Registrar, unsupported by \nany material whatsoever.  It cannot, therefore, be sustained.  The \nengaging, by military establishments, in trade, is not an unknown \nphenomenon; neither is it proscribed by law, at least in India. For that \nmatter, prisons and penitentiaries are also not known to be ordinarily \nengaging in trade; nonetheless, we are aware of the Tihar Jail in Delhi \nregularly marketing all varieties of goods, including textiles and \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 51 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 51 of 79 \n \n \ngarments, under the ‗TJ‘ logo.  Besides, the appellant has itself \napplied for registration of the \n device mark and the \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘ word mark for a variety of goods in a variety \nof classes, on ―proposed to be used‖ basis.  The applications are on \nrecord.  It cannot, therefore, be presumed that the appellant would not \nengage itself in manufacturing or trading activities.  In any event, the \nlearned Deputy Registrar could not have returned such a finding with \nno evidence, whatsoever, to support it. \n \n91. \nFor that matter, I do not see why, in facts such as these, the \nSlazenger38 principle should not apply by analogy.  There is no \nexplanation, whatsoever, forthcoming for Respondent 1 choosing to \nuse, in its trade marks, the red-and-white cross-and-square Swiss \ninsignia, or the words „SWISS MILITARY‟.  The use of the \n red-\nand-white cross-and-square Swiss insignia is not a right conferred on \neveryone, under Swiss law.  The intent to confuse is obvious.  The \nmilitary establishment of a country would, by right, be entitled to use \nits official insignia.  The use of the \n insignia, therefore, imbues the \nmark with a veneer of officialdom.  The use of \n, with „SWISS \nMILITARY‟ below it, therefore, appears to be a clear attempt to \nconfuse the unwary purchaser into drawing an association with the \nSwiss military establishment and the goods on which the mark is \naffixed.  Applying Slazenger38, there is no reason for the Court to \npresume that the attempt of Respondent 2 would not be successful.  \nTo disclaim any possibility of confusion or deception on the ground \nthat the corners of the square are not sharp but curved, or based on the \ncomparative lengths of the two arms of the white cross would, to my \nmind, be mere hairsplitting.

I am unable to agree.  In the first \nplace, the proscription under Section 9(2)(a) is an absolute \nproscription, independent of the identity of the objector.  Secondly, \neven on facts, the two marks cited by Mr. Sibal cannot estop the \nappellant from maintaining the present appeal.  The reason is obvious \nfrom a glance at the marks.  The \nmark has ―WENGER‖ \naccompanying the white and red cross, thereby clearly displaying the \nidentity of the licensee.  The \n mark does not even have a \nwhite and red cross.  These cases, therefore, are not similar to the case \nof Respondent 2.  They cannot, therefore, estop the appellant either \nfrom objecting to the impugned proposed mark of Respondent 2, or \nmaintaining the present appeal.     \n \nII. \nSection 1448 of the Trade Marks Act \n \n94. \nMr Anand sought to rely on the manner in which Respondent 1 \nwas advertising and promoting the goods on which the impugned \nmark was being used.

Though Mr. Sibal opposed the reliance on the \nadvertisements and promotional material on the ground that the \nproscription under Section 9(2)(a) applied only where the mark itself \nwas ―of such nature‖ as to deceive or cause confusion, Mr. Anand \nrelied on Section 1448 to justify reference to the manner in which the \nmark was being advertised and promoted by Respondent 1 as a factor \nwhich was required to be borne in mind even when examining the \nentitlement of the mark to registration in the face of Section 9(2)(a)6.   \n \n95. \nI find myself in agreement with Mr. Sibal.   \n \n96. \nSection 1448 requires the Registrar, in any proceeding relating \nto a trade mark, to admit evidence ―of the usage of the trade \nconcerned and of any relevant trade mark or trade name or get up \nlegitimately used by other persons‖.  The reference to the ―usage of \nthe trade concerned‖, when seen in conjunction with the immediately \nsucceeding expression ―any relevant trade mark or trade name or get \nup legitimately used by other persons‖ obviously refers to the manner \nin which the trade mark, forming subject matter of the proceedings, is \nused by the trade.  Usage of the trade is a factor which, in intellectual \nproperty law, especially in trade mark law, is relevant only while \nexamining whether the mark would infringe any other existing mark, \nor result in the consuming public being confused or deceived into \nbelieving the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark to be the goods \nof another, prior user.   \n \n97. \nRespondent 2 had, in the present case, applied for registration \nof the impugned mark on a ―proposed to be used‖ basis.

The appellant does not seek to contend that, prior to the \nimpugned order, Respondent 2 had been using the impugned mark for \ntextile items.  The manner in which Respondent 2 may have been \nutilising the \n mark in respect of which it held other subsisting \nregistrations for other items cannot, therefore, constitute a factor to be \nlegitimately taken into consideration by the learned Deputy Registrar \nwhile adjudicating on the application forming subject matter of \nconsideration in the present proceedings.  \n \n98. \nI am not inclined, therefore, to take into consideration the \nadvertisements and promotional material of Respondent 2 with respect \nto the use of the impugned mark of other items, for which it holds \nseparate registrations.  Section 144 of the Trade Marks Act does not, \nin my opinion, justify any such exercise.   \n \nIII. \nRe: Section 9(1)(b)5 \n \n99. \nMr. Sibal sought to contend that the appellant was estopped \nfrom invoking Sections 9(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act as the \nappellant had itself applied for registration of the word mark ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ as well as the device mark \n and relies, for \nthis purpose, on Indian Hotels22.  Insofar as the impugned \n is \nconcerned, the argument has no merit, as the \n and \n \nmarks are different. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 55 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 55 of 79 \n \n \n100. Mr. Anand sought to contend that the impugned mark was not \neligible for registration in view of Section 9(1)(b) of the Trade Marks \nAct. Section 9(1)(b) absolutely prohibits registration of trade marks \n―which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in \ntrade to designate‖, inter alia, the geographical origin of the goods.  \nMr. Anand‘s submission is that the impugned mark, which combines \nthe white cross on a red background and the words ―Swiss Military‖ \nbelow it, serves in trade to designate the geographical origin of the \ngoods on which the mark is affixed.  \n \n101. Mr. Anand has also relied, in this context, on the guidelines \ncontained in the Manual of Trade Marks and the Registry of Trade \nMarks relating to the registrations of Trade Marks which indicate the \ngeographical origin of the goods.  According to Mr. Anand, under the \nsaid Trade Mark Manual, a trade mark which is the name of a large \nand well-known country cannot be registered at all.  Switzerland \nbeing a large, well-known and well populated country, Mr. Anand \nsubmits that the guidelines contained in the Manual on Trade Marks \ncompletely proscribe registration of the words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ \nas a trade mark.  \n \n102. Mr. Sibal relies, per contra, on the GI Act and the provisions \ncontained therein for registration of a mark denoting the geographical \norigin of the goods. He submits that the establishment of a connection \nbetween the mark and the place of origin of the goods on which the \nmark is to be affixed is a pre-requisite under the GI Act, and not under \nthe Trade Marks Act.  He further submits that the words ―Swiss \nMilitary‖ cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be regarded as \ndenoting the geographical origin of the goods on which the impugned \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 56 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 56 of 79 \n \n \nmark is to be affixed. He seeks to contradistinguish the impugned \nmark, for this purpose, with, for example, the ―Made in Switzerland‖ \non ―Swiss made‖ marks.  Section 9(1)(a), according to Mr. Sibal, \napply to such latter marks,  which unequivocally point towards the \ngeographical origin of the goods, and not to a mark such as ―Swiss \nMilitary‖.  \n \n103. Having heard learned Counsel, what is immediately apparent \nfrom a reading of Section 9(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act is that the \nconsumer or customer is a stranger to the said provision.  The \nimpression of the mark on the consumer, or any other third person, is \nirrelevant, where Section 9(1)(b) is concerned.  Section 9(1)(b) is only \nconcerned with what the mark serves to designate in trade. It applies \nto marks which serve, in trade, to designate, inter alia, the \ngeographical origin of the goods (to the extent the provision concerns \nthe controversy at hand).  \n \n104. Unlike Section 9(2)(a), therefore, Section 9(1)(b) is concerned \nwith what the applicant seeking registration of the mark intends to \nconvey.  The word ―geographical origin‖, finding place in the \ncompany of the words ―kind‖, ―quality‖, ―quantity‖, ―intended \npurpose‖, ―values‖, and ―time of production‖, is required to be \ninterpreted noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis with the said \nexpressions. They obviously refer to the normal recitals contained on \npackages giving particulars of the goods. In the company of these \nexpressions, a mark can be said to ―designate the geographical origin‖  \nof the goods only where it unequivocally does so.  Section 9(2)(a), \nwould stand attracted even in a situation in which the mark, though it \ndoes not unequivocally indicate the geographical origin of the goods, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 57 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 57 of 79 \n \n \nmay confuse the public into assuming or believing such an origin.  \nPer contra, Section 9(1)(b) would apply only where the mark serves, \nin trade, to designate the geographical origin of the goods. \n \n105. In this context, the use of the word ―designate‖ is also of some \nimportance.  P. Ramanatha Aiyar in his Advanced Law Lexicon, \ndefines the word ―designate‖ thus: \n―To call by a distinctive title; to point out a thing by distinguishing it from \nothers; to express or declare; to indicate by description or by something \nknown and determinate, to point out, or mark by some particular token; to \nspecify.‖ \n \n \n―Designation‖, therefore, involves specific identification, with a \ndeclaratory component.  The word ―designate‖ is far more specific \nthan the word ―indicate‖.  Designation involves a positive act done by \nthe person who designates.  Additionally, it involves the intent to so \ndesignate.  It is only, therefore, where the trade mark, of which \nregistration is sought, consists exclusively of marks or indications \nwhich are intended to identify the geographical origin of the goods in \ntrade, that the mark becomes non-registrable under Section 9(1)(b) (to \nthe extent it is relevant for our purpose).  \n \n106. Read thus, it cannot be held that the use of the white cross on a \nred background, or the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ logo below it, serves in \ntrade to designate the geographical origin of the goods as being \nSwitzerland.   The possibility of such a mark confusing or deceiving \nthe public into believing that the goods are of Swiss origin when, in \nfact, they are not, may fatally imperil the entitlement of the mark to \nregistration in view of Section 9(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act; \nSection 9(1)(b) would not, however, stand attracted on that ground.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 58 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 58 of 79 \n \n \n107. In that view of the matter, I do not deem it necessary to advert \nto the Guidelines issued by the Trade Mark Registry for registration of \nmarks which indicate the geographical origin of goods.  In any event, \nthe applicability of the said guidelines seems questionable, as they \nrefer to use of names of places, countries, rivers, etc., as trademarks, \nand do not seem to apply to the use of a mark such as ―Swiss \nMilitary‖.  The decision in Imperial Tobacco10, on which Mr. Anand \nrelies, too, concerns itself with the entitlement, to registration, of the \nword ‗Shimla‘, which is the name of a place. \n \n108. Section 9(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act, therefore, does not \nrender the impugned mark ineligible for registration  as a trade mark. \n \nIV. \nRe: Section 11(3)(a)7 \n \n109. Much emphasis was placed, by Mr. Sibal, on the fact that, while \nthe grounds for refusal of registration envisaged by Section 9 were \n―absolute grounds‖ those envisaged by Section 11 were ―relative \ngrounds‖.  His submission is that ―relative grounds‖ would refer to \ngrounds which consider the mark, of which registration is being \nsought, in relation to some other mark. Adverting specifically to \nSection 11(3)(a), Mr. Sibal seeks to submit that the words ―by virtue \nof any law‖ with which the said provision commences, have to be \nread in the context of Section 11  as a whole and also noscitur a sociis \nwith the words ―law of passing off‖ and the ―law of copyright‖ which \nfind place in Clauses (a) and (b) of Section 11(3).  He has also pressed \ninto service, in this context, Section 11(5)26 of the Trade Marks Act.   \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 59 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 59 of 79 \n \n \n110. Mr. Anand contends, per contra, that the words ―by virtue of \nany law‖ are wide and all encompassing. The mere fact that the law of \npassing off has been particularized after the said expression in Section \n11(3)(a) cannot, in his submission, narrow the sweep and ambit of the \nwords ―any law‖. ―Any law‖, in Mr. Anand‘s submission, would refer \nprecisely to ―any law‖, meaning any law in force for the time being in \nIndia.  The Geneva Convention Act is also, therefore, according to \nhim, one of the laws which would stand embraced by the expression \n―any law‖ as used in Section 11(3)(a).   \n \n111. I must confess that the submissions of Mr. Anand did initially \nappeal to me.  On a deeper analysis of Section 11, however, I find \nmyself in agreement with Mr. Sibal. \n \n112. Section 11(3)(a), I may note, is a very unhappily worded \nprovision.  It is lacking in precision, which is one of the most essential \nattributes of good legislation.  I have, however, to interpret the \nprovision as it stands.   \n \n113. If one were to accept Mr. Anand‘s submission, the words ―by \nvirtue of any law‖ would encompass every law applicable in the \nterritory of India.  In that event, the Geneva Convention Act would \nalso be one such law.   \n \n114. In its recent judgment in Renaissance Hotel Holdings Inc. v. \nB. Vijaya Sai49, a Bench of three Hon‘ble Judges of the Supreme \nCourt has, in the context of a trade mark dispute, referred to certain \nimportant principles of interpretation of statutes, which courts are \n                                          \n49 (2022) 5 SCC 1 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 60 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 60 of 79 \n \n \nrequired to bear in mind in such cases.  Paras 65 to 68 of the report \nread thus: \n ―65.  We find that the High Court has failed to take into \nconsideration two important principles of interpretation. The first \none being of textual and contextual interpretation. It will be \napposite to refer to the guiding principles, succinctly summed up \nby Chinnappa Reddy, J., in the judgment of this Court in  \nRBI v. Peerless General Finance & Investment Co. Ltd.50: \n \n―33.  \nInterpretation must depend on the text and the \ncontext. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well \nsay if the text is the texture, context is what gives the \ncolour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That \ninterpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation \nmatch the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we \nknow why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute \nmust be read, first as a whole and then section by section, \nclause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a \nstatute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the \nglasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its \nscheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take \ncolour and appear different than when the statute is looked \nat without the glasses provided by the context. With these \nglasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover \nwhat each section, each clause, each phrase and each word \nis meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the \nentire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can \nbe construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so \nthat every word has a place and everything is in its place. It \nis by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting of \nthe entire Act and by reference to what preceded the \nenactment and the reasons for it that the court construed the \nexpression \n―Prize \nChit‖ \nin Srinivasa \nEnterprises v. U.O.I.51, and we find no reason to depart \nfrom the court's construction.‖ \n \n66.  \nIt is thus trite law that while interpreting the provisions of a \nstatute, it is necessary that the textual interpretation should be \nmatched with the contextual one. The Act must be looked at as a \nwhole and it must be discovered what each section, each clause, \neach phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit \ninto the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word \nof a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be \nconstrued so that every word has a place and everything is in its \nplace. As already discussed hereinabove, the said Act has been \nenacted by the legislature taking into consideration the increased \n                                          \n50 (1987) 1 SCC 424 \n51 (1980) 4 SCC 507 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 61 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 61 of 79 \n \n \nglobalisation of trade and industry, the need to encourage \ninvestment flows and transfer of technology, and the need for \nsimplification and harmonisation of trade mark management \nsystems. One of the purposes for which the said Act has been \nenacted is prohibiting the use of someone else's trade mark as a \npart of the corporate name or the name of business concern. If the \nentire scheme of the Act is construed as a whole, it provides for the \nrights conferred by registration and the right to sue for \ninfringement of the registered trade mark by its proprietor. The \nlegislative scheme as enacted under the said statute elaborately \nprovides for the eventualities in which a proprietor of the \nregistered trade mark can bring an action for infringement of the \ntrade mark and the limits on effect of the registered trade mark. By \npicking up a part of the provisions in sub-section (4) of Section 29 \nof the said Act and a part of the provision in sub-section (1) of \nSection 30 of the said Act and giving it a textual meaning without \nconsidering the context in which the said provisions have to be \nconstrued, in our view, would not be permissible. We are at pains \nto say that the High Court fell in error in doing so. \n \n67.  \nAnother principle that the High Court has failed to notice is \nthat a part of a section cannot be read in isolation. This Court, \nspeaking through A.P. Sen, J., in Balasinor Nagrik Coop. Bank \nLtd. v. Babubhai Shankerlal Pandya52, observed thus :  \n \n―4. … It is an elementary rule that construction of a section \nis to be made of all parts together. It is not permissible to \nomit any part of it. For, the principle that the statute must \nbe read as a whole is equally applicable to different parts \nof the same section.‖ \n \nThis \nprinciple \nwas \nreiterated \nby \nthis \nCourt \nin Kalawatibai v. Soiryabai53: \n \n―6. … It is well settled that a section has to be read in its \nentirety as one composite unit without bifurcating it or \nignoring any part of it.” \n \n68.  \nIgnoring this principle, the High Court has picked up clause \n(c) of sub-section (4) of Section 29 of the said Act in isolation \nwithout even noticing the other provisions contained in the said \nsub-section (4) of Section 29 of the said Act. Similarly, again \nwhile considering the import of sub-section (1) of Section 30 of the \nsaid Act, the High Court has only picked up clause (b) of sub-\nsection (1) of Section 30 of the said Act, ignoring the provisions \ncontained in clause (a) of the said sub-section (1) of Section 30 of \nthe said Act.‖ \n(Emphasis supplied) \n                                          \n52 (1987) 1 SCC 606 \n53 (1991) 3 SCC 410 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 62 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 62 of 79 \n \n \n115. The interpretation of a statutory provision must, therefore, be \ninformed by text and context alike. \n \n116. In that view of the matter, it may be erroneous on the part of the \ncourt to interpret the expression ―by virtue of any law‖, as it figures in \nSection 11(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, in isolation, and de hors the \nrest of the clause, the accompanying clause 11(3)(b) and the \nremaining sub-sections of Section 11.  The expression has to be \nunderstood in the backdrop of Section 11 as a whole, and the various \nsub-sections of which the section is constituted.  \n \n117. Let us, then do so, and see what emerges. \n \n118. The various proscriptions against registration of a trade mark, \nin Section 11, are to be found in sub-sections (1), (2) and (3)54 thereof.  \n \n119. Section 11(1) prohibits registration of a mark if, because of its \nidentity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services \ncovered thereby, or because of its similarity to an earlier mark and \nidentity of similarity of goods or services covered thereby, there exists \n                                          \n54 11.  \nRelative grounds for refusal of registration. –  \n(1)  \nSave as provided in Section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, because of –  \n(a)  \nits identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services \ncovered by the trade mark; or \n(b)  \nits similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods \nor services covered by the trade mark, \nthere exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of \nassociation with the earlier trade mark. \n(2)  \nA trade mark which –  \n(a)  \nis identical with or similar to an earlier trade mark; and \n(b)  \nis to be registered for goods or services which are not similar to those for which \nthe earlier trade mark is registered in the name of a different proprietor, \nshall not be registered if or to the extent the earlier trade mark is a well-known trade mark in India \nand the use of the later mark without due cause would take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to \nthe distinctive character or repute of the earlier trade mark. \n(3)  \nA trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent that, its use in India is liable to be \nprevented –  \n(a)  \nby virtue of any law in particular the law of passing off protecting an \nunregistered trade mark used in the course of trade; or \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 63 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 63 of 79 \n \n \na likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. The sub-section \nclarifies that, within the ambit of ―confusion‖ would be included the \nlikelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.   \n \n120. Section 11(2) protects earlier ―well-known trade marks‖, within \nthe meaning of Section 2(1)(zg)55 of the Trade Marks Act. Where an \nearlier trade mark is a well-known trade mark within the said \ndefinition, a later trade mark, which is identical or similar to the \nearlier trade mark, cannot be registered, if the use of such later mark \nwould take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to the distinctive \ncharacter or repute of, the earlier well-known trade mark.  \n \n121. Section 11(3) prohibits registration of a trade mark if its use in \nIndia is liable to be prevented either ―by virtue of any law in particular \nthe law of passing off‖ or ―by virtue of law of copyright‖. \n \n122. All proscriptions against registration of a trade mark, in Section \n11, therefore, refer to handicaps on registration in the light of earlier \nexisting intellectual property.  Clearly, they are intended at protecting \nexisting intellectual property, essentially either from infringement or \nfrom passing off.    \n \n123. This becomes starkly apparent when one reads Sections 9 and \n11 in juxtaposition.  The proscriptions envisaged by the various \nclauses of Section 9 are absolute, and do not involve comparison with \nany other existing mark, or any element of competing intellectual \n                                                                                                                   \n(b)  \nby virtue of law of copyright. \n55 (zg)  \n―well-known trade mark‖, in relation to any goods or services, means a mark which has become so \nto the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or receives such services that the use of such \nmark in relation to other goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course \nof trade or rendering of services between those goods or services and a person during the mark in relation to \nthe first-mentioned goods or services. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 64 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 64 of 79 \n \n \nproperty interests.

If \nthe mark, by its very nature and on its own, suffers from any of the \ndisqualifications envisaged by Section 9, it cannot be registered.  No \noccasion arises, therefore, under Section 9, to refer to any other mark.  \nMr. Sibal is, therefore, correct in his submission that the likelihood of \ndeception and confusion envisaged by Section 9(2)(a), too, has to be \nan attribute of the mark itself and seen on its own, and not in \ncomparison with, or vis-à-vis, any other mark.  It is for this reason that \nthe clause employs the expression ―by its very nature‖.   \n \n124. Section 9, therefore, applies to inherent attributes of the \napplicant mark, of its own, whereas Section 9 applies to attributes of \nthe mark vis-à-vis existing marks of others.  Ergo, Section 9 contains \n―absolute‖ grounds to refuse registration, whereas Section 11 contains \n―relative‖ grounds to do so. \n \n125. Even read in the context of Sections 11(1) and 11(2) and the \nother clauses of Section 11(3), or vis-à-vis Section 9, therefore, the \nwords ―by virtue of any law‖, as used in Section 11(3)(a), would \nappear to apply only to law which relates to protection of existing \nintellectual property of others.  \n \n126. Section 11(5), on which Mr. Sibal rightly relies, sets the issue, \nin a way, at rest.  \n \n127. Section 11(5) is couched in mandatory terms, as is apparent \nfrom the use of the word ―shall‖. It states that registration of a mark \n―shall not be refused ... on the grounds specified in sub-sections (2) \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 66 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 66 of 79 \n \n \nand (3)‖ unless the proprietor of ―the earlier trade mark‖ opposes the \nregistration on one or more of the grounds envisaged by Sections \n11(2) and 11(3). The right to refuse registration of a mark under \nSection 11(3), therefore, is subject to the pre-condition envisaged by \nSection 11(5) applying.  It is only where the proprietor of an earlier \ntrade mark objects to registration of the proposed mark on one of the \ngrounds envisaged by Sections 11(2) and 11(3), in appropriate \nopposition proceedings, that registration of a mark can be refused \nunder either of the said provisions.  \n \n128. This places the matter beyond pale of doubt.  The pre-condition \nfor Sections 11(2) and 11 (3) to apply, as statutorily engrafted in \nSection 11(5), requires an opposition by a proprietor of an earlier \ntrade mark.  The proprietor of the earlier trade mark has, therefore, to \nobject to registration of the proposed mark on the ground (i) that it is \nidentical with or similar to an earlier well-known trade mark, (ii) the \nuse of the mark in India is liable to be prevented by any law, in \nparticular the law of passing off or (iii) the use of the mark in India is \nliable to be prevented by the law of copyright.  \n \n129. The legislative intent, clearly, is to balance the right of an \napplicant seeking registration of the later mark, with the intellectual \nproperty rights which vest in the proprietor of the earlier mark.    \n \n130. This conclusion is also supported by the use of the particular \narticle ―the‖ used in the expression ―the earlier trade mark‖ in Section \n11(5).  The use of the article ―the‖ indicates that all proscriptions in \nSections 11(5) (2) and (3) are intended to apply to proprietorial rights \nvesting in the proprietor of an earlier trade mark.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 67 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 67 of 79 \n \n \n131. The words ―any law‖, as employed in Section 11(3)(a), would \nalso, therefore, have to be understood in this background. They cannot \nbe understood as referring to any law in force in India, which has \nnothing to do with intellectual property rights vesting in the proprietor \nof any earlier mark.  \n \n132. As Mr. Sibal correctly submits, if the word ―any law‖, finding \nplace in Section 11(3)(a) is to embrace all laws in force in India, the \nproscription would cease to be ―relative‖, and would become \n―absolute‖.  It would, then, appropriately have to find place in Section \n9, not in Section 11.  Additionally, if such were the interpretation, it \nwould be illogical to restrict the right to object to registration, on that \nground, only to proprietors of earlier trade marks, as Section 11(5) \nordains.  The fact that Section 11(3) applies only where an objection \nto registration, on the grounds envisaged in the said sub-sections, is \nraised by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark, indicates that the \nprovision does not envisage an absolute ground to refuse registration, \nbut envisages, instead, an objection predicated on the prejudice \nsuffered by the intellectual property rights of the proprietor of the \nearlier trade mark.   \n \n133. It is not necessary, therefore, for me to venture into noscitur a \nsociis territory as, even read in conjunction with Section 9 and the \nother provisions of Section 11, in the light of the principles enunciated \nin paras 66 to 68 of Renaissance Hotels Holdings49, the words ―by \nvirtue of any law‖, as employed in Section 11(3)(a), cannot be \nextended to embrace every law applicable in the territory of India. \nTheir sweep has to be restricted to laws which impact proprietorial \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 68 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 68 of 79 \n \n \nintellectual property rights vested in the proprietor of an earlier trade \nmark, as is specifically ordained by Section 11(5).  \n \n134. The 13th Lok Sabha debates, on which both sides placed \nreliance, fortify the conclusion.  Despite a specific recommendation, \nin the Debates, to further elaborate Clause 11(3)(a) of the Trade \nMarks Bill – which metamorphosed into Section 11(3)(a) of the Trade \nMarks Act after Presidential sanction – to protect India‘s \ncommitments under the Universal and Berne Copyright Conventions, \nand its obligations under the TRIPS agreement, these suggestions \nwere never acted upon.  The legislative intent was always, therefore, \nto restrict the proscriptions against registration to the intellectual \nproperty rights available under intellectual property legislation in \nIndia.    \n \n135. In that view of the matter, the learned Deputy Registrar cannot \nbe faulted in declining the objection of the appellant against \nregistration of the impugned mark, predicated on Section 11(3) of the \nTrade Marks Act.  \n \n136. Besides, and even otherwise, Mr. Sibal is also correct on facts \nin pointing out that the appellant is not a proprietor of an earlier trade \nmark. Clearly, therefore, in view of Section 11(5), the registration of \nthe impugned mark, as sought by the Respondent 2, could not have \nbeen refused by the learned Deputy Registrar under Sections 11(2) or \n11(3) at the instance of the appellant.  \n \nV. \nPower of the learned Deputy Registrar to consider other laws \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 69 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 69 of 79 \n \n \n137. I have held, earlier, that the words ―any law‖, in Section \n11(3)(a) cannot extend to statutes which do not involve considerations \nof intellectual property rights of others and that, therefore, the Geneva \nConventions Act does not fall within the parenthetic embrace of the \nphrase ―any law‖.  But what if the use of the mark, of which \nregistration is sought, is absolutely proscribed by some other law, as \nthe German Conventions Act does in the present case, according to \nMr. Anand?  Can the Registrar register a mark the use of which stands \nstatutorily proscribed elsewhere? \n \n138. The answer, in my view, has to be in the affirmative.  The \nRegistrar of Trade Marks is appointed under Section 3(1)56 of the \nTrade Marks Act, and the learned Deputy Registrar, who has passed \nthe impugned order, has apparently been empowered to do so by the \nAct.  In either case, the appointment of the officer is ―for the purposes \nof this Act‖.  In M.A. Kochu Devassy v. State of Kerala57, the \nSupreme Court held that the expression ― ‗for the purposes of the Act‘ \nsurely means for the purposes of all and not only some of the \nprovisions of the Act.‖  The expression ―for the purpose of the said \nAct‖ was understood, in Ashok Leyland Ltd v. State of Tamil Nadu58 \nas ―for the purpose of all the provisions of the said Act‖.   \n \n139. The power and authority of the learned Registrar, therefore, \nstand circumscribed by the provisions of the Trade Marks Act.   He is \nappointed for discharging functions under the Act, and is the \nadministrative, and quasi-judicial, modus for grant of registration to \n                                          \n56 3.  \nAppointment of Registrar and other officers. –   \n(1) \nThe Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint a person to \nbe known as the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, who shall be the \nRegistrar of Trade Marks for the purposes of this Act. \n57 (1979) 2 SCC 117 : AIR 1979 SC 358 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 70 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 70 of 79 \n \n \ntrade marks and performing all functions ancillary thereto.  The \nsphere of his authority, in the matter of refusal of registration cannot, \ntherefore, extend beyond Sections 9 to 16 of the Trade Marks Act, of \nwhich Sections 9 and 11 contain the absolute and relative grounds on \nwhich registration can be refused.  Section 23(1)59 mandates that, \nwhere the registration of the mark has been opposed and the \nopposition has been decided in favour of the applicant, the mark shall \nbe registered.  No discretion vests in the learned Deputy Registrar, \nonce the opposition is decided in favour of the applicant seeking \nregistration.   \n \n140. Though, therefore, the Trade Marks Act does not contain any \nexpress proscription against the learned Deputy Registrar travelling \noutside its scope in search of any other possible statutory fetters on \nregistration, it is clear that, holistically read, the Trade Marks Act \nforms a composite and self-contained code, in the matter of \nregistration.  The learned Deputy Registrar has, therefore, to limit the \nscope of inquiry, into the entitlement of the proposed mark to \nregistration, to the considerations that find place in the Trade Marks \nAct, and cannot travel outside it. \n \nVI. \nSection 12 of the Geneva Convention Act, independently seen \n                                                                                                                   \n58 (2004) 3 SCC 1 : AIR 2004 SC 2836 \n59 23.  \nRegistration. –  \n(1)  \nSubject to the provisions of Section 19, when an application for registration of a trade \nmark has been accepted and either— \n(a)  \nthe application has not been opposed and the time for notice of opposition has \nexpired; or \n(b)  \nthe application has been opposed and the opposition has been decided in favour \nof the applicant, \nthe Registrar shall, unless the Central Government otherwise directs, register the said trade \nmark within eighteen months of the filing of the application and the trade mark when registered \nshall be registered as of the date of the making of the said application and that date shall, subject to \nthe provisions of Section 154, be deemed to be the date of registration. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 71 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 71 of 79 \n \n \n141. The above conclusion would stand fortified even by Section 12 \nof the Geneva Conventions Act itself.  What Section 12 proscribes is \nuse of the heraldic emblem of the Swiss confederation.  There is a \nstatutory distinction between registration and use of a trade mark.  \nUse follows registration.  Section 28(1)60 of the Trade Marks Act \nmakes this clear.  The proprietor of a registered trade mark is, by \nSection 28(1), invested with the right to use it.  Section 12 of the \nGeneva Conventions Act, therefore, affects, if at all, the right to use \nthe mark, not the right to have it registered.  The right to registration \nstands circumscribed by the Trade Marks Act, which remains a \ncomplete code in that regard.  If the right to use the mark, once \nregistered, is subject to some other statutory proscription, that \nproscription operates outside the peripheries of the Trade Marks Act.  \nIf such a proscription exists, and the proprietor of the trade mark \nviolates it, the violation may well invite sanctions as envisaged by the \nproscribing statute.  The right to registration of the mark is unaffected \nby any such proscription.  The learned Deputy Registrar, and, \nconsequently, this Court which is sitting in appeal over the decision of \nthe learned Deputy Registrar, is not required to venture into that \nterritory, as it is concerned only with the entitlement of the impugned \nmark to registration, and not to the entitlement of Respondent 2 to use \nthe mark, once registered if at all.   \n \n142. To my knowledge, there does not exist, outside the Trade \nMarks Act, any proscription against registration of a trade mark.  Nor \nhas Mr. Anand invited my attention to any such proscription. \n                                          \n60 28.  \nRights conferred by registration. –  \n(1)  \nSubject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, \ngive to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in \nrelation to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief \nin respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 72 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 72 of 79 \n \n \nVII. Other Issues \n \n143. The impugned order of the Learned Deputy Registrar allows the \nregistration of the impugned \n mark without limitation of colour.  \nBy application of Section 10(2) of the Trade Marks Act, therefore, it \nalso registers the mark with a white cross on red background, as  \n.  \nTo that extent, the imugned order is not sustainable, as  \n(i) \nthe \n mark, when used for goods of Chinese origin, would \namount to a ―false trade description‖ within the meaning of Section \n2(1)(i)(IV), and would therefore be ineligible to registration, and \n(ii) \nthe mark would additionally be ineligible to registration under \nSection 9(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act. \n \nVII.1 Re. Tax Invoice dated 12th July 2008 \n \n144. Relying on Cabinet Circular dated 15th July 2010, which \nofficially notified the ₹ symbol for the Indian Rupee, Mr. Anand \nsought to contend that Tax Invoice dated 12th July 2008 was \nfabricated, as it used the said ₹ symbol two years prior thereto.  The \nsubmission, though seemingly fragile, is not without significance.  \nThe only response of Mr. Sibal, to this submission, was that the \nsoftware used by Respondent 1 was employing the ₹ symbol for the \nIndian Rupee.  In fact, web research reveals that the ₹ sign was \nshortlisted from the entries received pursuant to a contest for \nsubmitting entries for a new symbol for the Indian Rupee announced \nby the Indian Government on 5th January 2009.  Out of 3331 \nresponses received, five were shortlisted, from which the ₹ symbol \nwas selected in a meeting held of the Union Council of Ministers held \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 73 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 73 of 79 \n \n \non 15th July 2010.  Respondent 2 would, therefore, have to explain, \nsatifactorily, how the Tax Invoice, bearing the ₹ symbol, came to be \nissued by it on 12th July 2008.   \n \n145. Respondent 2 has failed to do so.  Though the point was raised \nbefore the learned Deputy Registrar, albeit in written submissions \nafter conclusion of hearing, no reply, to the point, was provided by \nRespondent 2.  The point has again been urged in these proceedings \nby the appellant, and the only explanation forthcoming, from \nRespondent 2, is that it was a feature of the software used by it.  The \nreply is thoroughly unsatisfactory.  The developers of the software \ncannot be presumed to be blessed with the gift of clairvoyance, to be \nable to divine the symbol that would be adopted for the Indian rupee \neven before suggestions for suitable symbols were invited by the \nGovernment from the public.   \n \n146. Prima facie, therefore, Respondent 2 has failed to satisfactorily \nrebut the appellant‘s contention regarding the Tax Invoice dated 12th \nJuly 2008.  The submission, of Respondent 2, that the contention was \nirrelevant as it had applied for the impugned mark on a ―proposed to \nbe used‖ basis is obviously without merit.  Submission of a fabricated \ndocument for having a mark registered would ipso facto disentitle the \napplicant to registration.  The matter cannot be wished away by \nreferring to any number of other invoices which Respondent 2 might \nhave submitted in support of its application for registration.  One \nsingle fabricated document is itself sufficient to reject the application.  \nNo benefit, in law, can enure in favour of a fabricator.  The hands of \none who seeks a benefit, which the law provides, have to be clean. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 74 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 74 of 79 \n \n \n147. Having said that, I do not deem it appropriate to use this factor \nas determinative of the issue in controversy, as it was, in fact, raised \nby the appellant only after hearing before the learned Deputy \nRegistrar had concluded, in written submissions.  Had it been raised \nduring the proceedings before him, Respondent 2 would have had a \nchance to rebut the allegation.  That opportunity not having been \nextended to Respondent 2 before the impugned order came to be \npassed, and, as I find the impugned mark ineligible to registration on \nother grounds, the matter is laid to rest with the above prima facie \nobservations.   \n \n \nVII.2 Re. Copyright Registration of Respondent 1 dated 29th April \n2005 \n  \n \n148. The genuineness, or othewise, of Copyright Registration No. A-\n71091/2005, held by Respondent 1, is completely irrelevant to the \nissue at hand.  I do not intend, therefore, to address the submissions of \nMr Anand in that regard. \n \nVIII. The black-and-white cross with ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ (the \n \nmark) \n \n \n149. Can it, then, be said that the impugned mark, if used in a black-\nand-white format, i.e. as \n, is registerable? \n \n150. I have held the \n mark not to be available for registration as \na trade mark under the Trade Marks Act, by virtue of Section 9(2)(a) \nthereof.  Would Section 9(2)(a) not be breached if the mark were in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 75 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 75 of 79 \n \n \nblack-and-white? \n \n151. The answer should be obvious. \n \n152. Section 9(2)(a) uses the words ―of such nature as to deceive the \npublic or cause confusion‖.  I have already held that the impugned \nmark, when used in a red-and-white colour format, is of such nature as \nto confuse the public into linking the goods, on which the mark \nfigures, with Switzerland; in other words, of presuming the goods to \nbe of Swiss origin.   \n \n153. This impression is not attributable solely to the red-and-white \ncolour scheme of the mark.  The words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ have a \nlarge part to play in the impression that the mark would carry.  It \nwould be folly to analogize a mark such as ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ \nwith a mark such as, for example, ‗PETER ENGLAND‘ which, as a \nphrase has no etymological meaning at all, so that it it becomes \ninstantly fanciful, and can, therefore, be kept out of the reckoning.  \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘, however, conjures up an instant mental \npicture of the Swiss military establishment.  A mental connection with \nSwitzerland is, therefore, inevitably made.  That, by itself, satisfies the \nrequirement of ―causing confusion‖ envisaged by Section 9(2)(a).   \n \n154. The Slazenger38 principle would also equally apply here.   \nThere is no explanation for the adoption, by Respondent 2, of the \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘ moniker.  The use of the word ‗MILITARY‘ is \nseriously prejudicial to the case of Respondent 2.  It is not a word \nlightly used, or, for that matter, to be lightly used.  The pleadings of \nRespondent 2 do not throw light on the motivation for adoption of the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 76 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 76 of 79 \n \n \nsaid phrase as a trade mark.  Being such an unusual use, the mark is \nbound, in the perception of the ordinary consumer, to suggest a link to \nthe Swiss official establishment; and, perhaps, even to the Swiss \nmilitary establishment. In the absence of any material to suggest that \nthere was an absolute embargo on the Swiss military establishment \nusing the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ appellation on goods put up for \ntrade, the learned Deputy Registrar was not, in my view, justified in \npresuming that persons would never connect the goods, on which the \nmark figures, with the Swiss military establishment. \n \n155. If, for example, backpacks bearing the words ‗INDIAN AIR \nFORCE‘ were to be seen by persons outside India, it is obvious, to my \nmind, that they would presume a link with the Indian Air Force, \nwhether the words were, or were not, accompanied by the official \nIndian Air Force insignia.  The words ‗INDIAN AIR FORCE‘, like \nthe words ―‗SWISS MILITARY‘ carry their own solemn \nconnotation. It is not easily that the ordinary person – who, as already \nnoted, is a person who is aware and capable of discrimination – is \nlikely to presume that the expression ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ is being \nused for ordinary commercially traded goods – as, however, they are – \nunconnected with the Swiss military establishment.   \n \n156. In fact, the exception that the Swiss military establishment has, \nas the appellant in this case, taken to the use of the impugned mark by \nRespondent 2, speaks for itself. \n \n157. Even if used in a black and white format, therefore, the \nimpugned mark would be ineligible for registration, in view of \nSection 9(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, as it is of a nature which \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 77 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 77 of 79 \n \n \nwould cause confusion in the mind of the public.   \n \n \nThe Sequitur \n \n158. The impugned order dated  25th July 2022, insofar as it allows \nthe registration of the \n mark in respect of textiles without limitation \nof colour, cannot sustain, whether the mark be used in a red-and-white \nor a black-and-white format.

The mark of Respondent 2 of which the impugned order dated \n25th July 2022, passed by the learned Deputy Registrar of Trademarks \nallows registration is ‗SWISS MILITARY‟ simpliciter, without any \ncross, either black and white or red and white.   \n \n160. Mr. Anirudh Bakhru appears on behalf of Respondent 2 in this \nappeal.  While adopting the submissions of Mr. Sibal in CA (COMM. \nIPD-TM) 158/2022 in all other respects, he submits that there are two \ndistinguishing features in this case.  The first is that, as the mark does \nnot use the official Swiss \n insignia, so that there can be no question \nof Section 11(3)(a), read with the Geneva Conventions Act, applying.  \nThe second is that the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ mark, independently \nand unaccompanied by the red and white \n cross, is unlikely to \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 78 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000019 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 158/2022 & cont. matter \nPage 78 of 79 \n \n \ndeceive or confuse the consumer, thereby ruling out the applicability \nof Section 9(1)(b) and 9(2)(a) as well.   \n \n161. I agree with Mr. Bakhru, but only in part.  Section 11(3)(a) \nwould not apply to the present case.   \n \n162. The observations and findings returned by me with respect to \nthe applicability of Section 9(2)(a) to the \n mark, as contained in \nparas 153 to 160 supra, would apply mutatis mutandis to the ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ mark impugned in this appeal.  The use of the ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ appellation, even by itself and sans any accompanying \nembellishments or emblems, has the clear propensity of creating \nconfusion in the mind of the public, regarding the origin of the goods \non which the mark is used.  The ―confusion factor‖ is the use of the \nappellation ‗SWISS MILITARY‘, and not a black and white cross, \nthough the use of the black and white cross may add to the confusion.  \nSection 9(2)(a) would, therefore, apply even if the mark ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ is used without the accompanying black and white \ncross.    \n \nConclusion \n \n163. Accordingly, the impugned orders dated 25th July 2022 are \nquashed and set aside. It is held that the marks \n, \n  and ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ are all ineligible for registration in respect of textiles, as \nclaimed by the respondent.

His client, however, seriously \nobjects to Respondent 2 being permitted to register or use either (i) a \nwhite cross on a red background, i.e. \n or (ii) the appellation \n―SWISS MILITARY‖.  Neither mark, submits Mr Anand, can be \npermitted either to be registered or used, in view of various statutory \nproscriptions which are in place.  What Respondent 2 actually uses, he \nseeks to point out, is \n, i.e. a white cross on a red background with \nthe ―SWISS MILITARY‖ appellation below it.   \n \n5. \nInasmuch as the impugned order dated 25th July 2022, read with \nSection 10(2)1 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, allows Respondent 2 to \ndo so, the appellant calls the said order into question in these appeals. \n \n6. \nMr. Akhil Sibal, at the very outset of his submissions, submitted \nthat his client was willing to restrict the registration of the impugned \nmark to a black and white colour combination, without using red.

In \nthis context, Mr. Anand submits that the onus is always on the \napplicant seeking registration of its mark to establish the existence of a \ngeographical connect between the goods on which the mark is used \nand the location to which the mark adverts, for which he relies on para \n6 of Amritdhara Pharmacy v Satya Deo Gupta15 and In Re Dunn's \nTrade-marks.16.  \n \n30. \nOn the aspect of likelihood of confusion or deception, paras 27 \nto 29 of the impugned order read thus: \n―27. \nNow, if we see the impugned trademark in the Indian \ncontext, the defense forces in India – be it – the army or military, \nair force or navy, all are held in high respect as performing the \nsovereign function to protect and defend the territorial sovereignty \nand integrity of the country. They are never regarded as entities \ninvolved in commercial activities and doing trade or business in \nthe impugned goods i.e. textile items,and for the purpose having or \nusing trade or business marks.

Additionally, the \nLd.

The registration of \ntrademerks in India is governed by the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and \nrules framed thereunder. Therefore, the validity and entitlement of \nthe impugned trademark for registration is to be tried and tested in \naccordance with the provisions of the Trade Marks Act and rules. \n \n32. \nThe Trade Marks Act and rules do not provide for any \nobjection to any application for registration af a trademark on \nground that it violates the provisions of the Paris Convention or \nTRIPS. However, as an obligation of the Country towards \ninternational conventions. I deem it fit to consider the said \nobjection raised by the opponent. \n \n***** \n \n35. \nFurther, the registration and protection of geographical \nindication in India is governed by the Geographical Indications \n(Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 and rules framed \nthereunder. Any geographical indications to have statutory \nprotection from unauthorized use are to be registered under the GI \nlaw of India. \n \n36. \nAs already stated earlier, India is a sovereign country \ngoverned by its own laws. Even it is accepted for a moment that \nthe impugned mark is a Swiss appellation/geographical indication \nunder Swiss laws, the same is of no effect as the Swiss laws have \nno force and applicability within India and from my personal \nknowledge SWISS MILITARY is not registered as a geographical \nindication in India under the provisions of the Geographical \nIndication (Registration and Protection) Act, 2002. \n \n37. \nThus, Article 22 of the TRIPS relating to protection of \ngeographical indication has no applicability to the present matter. \nThe contention of the opponent is accordingly rejected. \n \n38. \nFurther, given that SWISS MILITARY is not a registered \ngeographical indication in India, I also reject the contention of the \nopponent that the impugned trademark amounts to falsely applying \nthe \ntrademark \ninvolving \na \nwrongful \nindication \nof \nsource/appellation/geographical indication, therefore, barred by the \nprovisions of Sections 102, 103 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. \n \n39. \nNow, Article 6ter of the Paris Convention contains \nprohibitions concerning use, without authorization by the \ncompetent authorities, either as a trademark or as elements of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

The impugned \ntrademark comprising white cross on a black background is \nidentical/substantially similar to/slavish imitation of the said Swiss \nemblem, therefore, prohibited under Article 6ter of the Paris \nConvention. \n \n41. \nIn order to appreciate the above contention raised by the \nopponent, the Swiss emblem and the impugned trademark are \nreproduced as under – \n \n \n \n42. \nAs could be seen, the Swiss emblem of Swiss Cross \ncomprises of a white cross completely surounded by a red ground \nin square shape. The vertical and horizontal arms of the cross are of \nthe same length and width. On the other hand, the impugned \ntrademark is a composite label in black and white color scheme. It \ncomprises of a device of white cross surrounded by a black ground \nin square shape with rounded corners and underneath the word \nSWISS followed by the word MILITARY below it as prominent \nand essential feature of the mark. The vertical and horizontal arms \nof the cross used in the impugned trademark do not appear to be of \nthe same length and width. Even if one compares the device of \ncross in the impugned trademark with the Cross in the Swis \nemblem, the Swiss Cross has a particular symmetry and colour \nscheme which is completely different from the device of cross in \nthe impugned trademark which is white in colour surrounded by \nblack ground in square shape with rounded corners. Thus, not only \nafter thoughtful consideration and comparison of two marks as a \nwhole but also in the first impression, the two marks appear \ndifferent from each other. The Ld. Consel for the opponent has \nargued that in case the impugned trademarks in registered in black \nand white, as per section 10 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, it would \nbe deemed to be registered for all colors, therefore, color of the \nimpugned trademark is not of much significance for the purpose of \ncomparison of the marks.

Section \n11(5) ordains that a mark shall not be refused registration \nunder, inter alia, Section 11(3) unless an objection is raised in \nopposition proceedings by the proprietor of the earlier trade \nmark.  Thus, the right to object under Section 11(3) is available \nonly to the proprietor of an earlier trade mark.  The appellant \ndoes not own any earlier trade mark.

Article 53 is not, therefore, enforceable at law.  \nAdverting to Section 12, Mr. Sibal submits that the Section does not \nincorporate an absolute prohibition, as use of the white-and-red cross \nrepresenting the Swiss insignia is permissible, albeit with the \napproval of the Central Government.   \n \n54. \nMr. Sibal next specifically addresses clauses (d) and (e) of \nSection 12 of the Geneva Conventions Act.

He underscores the finding, of the EUIPO, that \n―potential deception unconnected to the quality of the goods/services \nprovided under the mark, and which does not impact consumer \nprotection, cannot lead to deceit under Article 7(1)(g) EUTMR‖.  The \nposition in Indian law, he points out, is different, as the test is \n―likelihood‖ to result in confusion or deception, not actual deceit. \nBesides, in that case, the impugned mark was ‗SWISS MILITARY \nBY PSM‘, which was different from the impugned mark in the \npresent case.  Again, the impugned mark in the EUIPO order did not \nmake use of the cross, unlike the impugned mark before this Court.  \nDrawing attention to the findings in the EUIPO order, Mr. Anand \npoints out that the EUIPO, in that case, specifically held that  ―the \nexpression ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ in conjunction with ‗BY PSM‘ \nrules out any connection to the Swiss Army or Swiss military \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

What matters is whether the consumer would be deceived or confused into believing the goods were manufactured in Switzerland, not by the Swiss army.\n\nTo distinguish between \"deception\" and \"confusion\", the court cites Lord Denning's comments from Parker-Knoll Ltd v.

Whether the average consumer would regard the goods as \nmade or manufactured by the Swiss army, or the Swiss military \nestablishment is, therefore, irrelevant.  What has to be seen is whether \nthe average consumer – with the intellectual abilities attributed to him \nby Compass Publishing43 – would be deceived, or confused, into \nbelieving the goods to have been manufactured or produced in \nSwitzerland, not manufactured or produced by the Swiss army.   \n \n85. \n―Deception‖ and ―confusion‖ are different concepts, and, on the \ndistinction between the two, the following exordium of Lord Denning \nin Parker-Knoll Ltd v. Knoll International Ltd47 (cited, with approval \nby the Supreme Court, in, inter alia, F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. \nGeoffrey Manner & Co.

Mr. Anand has \ndrawn my attention to the actual use of the said mark, inter alia on a \nbackpack, the photograph of which is to be found in para 24 supra.  \nThe mark, as actually used, does not make apparent, to the person \nviewing the mark, any difference in the lengths of the arms of the \nwhite cross, or any roundness in the edges of the corners of the \nsquare.  In fact, para 7 of the affidavit filed by Respondent 2 in \nsupport of its application for registration acknowledges that \nRespondent 2 is the owner and proprietor ―of the said trademark/label \nwhich is duly registered in India under the Trade Mark Act, 1999‖ \nand proceeds to furnish a tabular statement of the said registration, \nwhich states that Respondent 1 holds registrations of \n(i) \nthe mark \n for key chains, \n(ii) \nthe mark \n for pens, \n(iii) the mark \n for school bags, back packs, cross bags, \nsoft luggage, travelling bags, purses, etc. and \n(iv) \nthe mark \n for leather and leather imitations, animal \nskins, hides, trunks, umbrellas, etc. \nThese marks are identical to the impugned mark.

At the cost of repetition, \nthey may once again be reproduced thus: \n―The Ld. Counsel for the opponent has argued that in case the \nimpugned trademarks is registered in black and white, as per \nsection 10 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, it would be deemed to be \nregistered for all colors, therefore, color of the impugned \ntrademark is not of much significance for the purpose of \ncomparison of the marks. I do agree with the Ld. Counsel for the \nopponent to the extent he says that as per section 10, a mark if \nregistered in black and white colour would be deemed to be \nregistered for all colors, however, it doesn’t naturally follow from \nthis that the mark would be deemed to be registered in every \npossible color scheme/combination of colors including the color \nscheme/combination of colors of the Swiss emblem.‖ \n(Emphasis supplied) \n \nTo my mind, the italicized words in the afore-extracted passage from \nthe impugned order return two mutually contradictory findings.  In the \nfirst breath, the learned Deputy Registrar agrees that the registration \nof the impugned mark without limitation of colour would deem it to \nbe registered for all colours.  In the very same breath, he goes on to \nobserve that it would not naturally follow that the mark would be \ndeemed to be registered in every possible colour scheme/combination \nof colours.  This distinction, between ―all colours‖ and ―every \npossible colour scheme/combination of colours‖, to my mind, is too \nfacile to pass legal muster.  In any event, in the present case, there is \nonly one colour involved, apart from black and white, which is red.  \nOnce, therefore, the \n mark stood registered for all colours, it also \nstands registered for use by substituting the black with a red \nbackground.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

On page 51, the judge discusses that:\n\n* The Appellant has applied for registration of device marks and word marks related to goods in various classes.\n* There is no evidence to support the Deputy Registrar's finding that the Appellant would not engage in manufacturing or trading activities.\n* The Slazenger principle (Slazenger v. Mobil Oil, 1980) may be applicable by analogy in this case, given the Respondent's use of Swiss insignia and word marks such as \"SWISS MILITARY\".\n* The use of the red-and-white cross-and-square Swiss insignia appears to be an attempt to confuse consumers into associating the goods with the Swiss military establishment.\n* The court should not presume that the attempt to confuse would not be successful, and minor differences between the marks (e.g., curved corners) are irrelevant.\n\n**PDF Source:** 26.

The applications are on \nrecord.  It cannot, therefore, be presumed that the appellant would not \nengage itself in manufacturing or trading activities.  In any event, the \nlearned Deputy Registrar could not have returned such a finding with \nno evidence, whatsoever, to support it. \n \n91. \nFor that matter, I do not see why, in facts such as these, the \nSlazenger38 principle should not apply by analogy.  There is no \nexplanation, whatsoever, forthcoming for Respondent 1 choosing to \nuse, in its trade marks, the red-and-white cross-and-square Swiss \ninsignia, or the words „SWISS MILITARY‟.  The use of the \n red-\nand-white cross-and-square Swiss insignia is not a right conferred on \neveryone, under Swiss law.  The intent to confuse is obvious.  The \nmilitary establishment of a country would, by right, be entitled to use \nits official insignia.  The use of the \n insignia, therefore, imbues the \nmark with a veneer of officialdom.  The use of \n, with „SWISS \nMILITARY‟ below it, therefore, appears to be a clear attempt to \nconfuse the unwary purchaser into drawing an association with the \nSwiss military establishment and the goods on which the mark is \naffixed.  Applying Slazenger38, there is no reason for the Court to \npresume that the attempt of Respondent 2 would not be successful.  \nTo disclaim any possibility of confusion or deception on the ground \nthat the corners of the square are not sharp but curved, or based on the \ncomparative lengths of the two arms of the white cross would, to my \nmind, be mere hairsplitting.

In this context, the use of the word ―designate‖ is also of some \nimportance.  P. Ramanatha Aiyar in his Advanced Law Lexicon, \ndefines the word ―designate‖ thus: \n―To call by a distinctive title; to point out a thing by distinguishing it from \nothers; to express or declare; to indicate by description or by something \nknown and determinate, to point out, or mark by some particular token; to \nspecify.‖ \n \n \n―Designation‖, therefore, involves specific identification, with a \ndeclaratory component.  The word ―designate‖ is far more specific \nthan the word ―indicate‖.  Designation involves a positive act done by \nthe person who designates.  Additionally, it involves the intent to so \ndesignate.  It is only, therefore, where the trade mark, of which \nregistration is sought, consists exclusively of marks or indications \nwhich are intended to identify the geographical origin of the goods in \ntrade, that the mark becomes non-registrable under Section 9(1)(b) (to \nthe extent it is relevant for our purpose).  \n \n106. Read thus, it cannot be held that the use of the white cross on a \nred background, or the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ logo below it, serves in \ntrade to designate the geographical origin of the goods as being \nSwitzerland.   The possibility of such a mark confusing or deceiving \nthe public into believing that the goods are of Swiss origin when, in \nfact, they are not, may fatally imperil the entitlement of the mark to \nregistration in view of Section 9(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act; \nSection 9(1)(b) would not, however, stand attracted on that ground.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

In that view of the matter, I do not deem it necessary to advert \nto the Guidelines issued by the Trade Mark Registry for registration of \nmarks which indicate the geographical origin of goods.  In any event, \nthe applicability of the said guidelines seems questionable, as they \nrefer to use of names of places, countries, rivers, etc., as trademarks, \nand do not seem to apply to the use of a mark such as ―Swiss \nMilitary‖.  The decision in Imperial Tobacco10, on which Mr. Anand \nrelies, too, concerns itself with the entitlement, to registration, of the \nword ‗Shimla‘, which is the name of a place. \n \n108. Section 9(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act, therefore, does not \nrender the impugned mark ineligible for registration  as a trade mark. \n \nIV. \nRe: Section 11(3)(a)7 \n \n109. Much emphasis was placed, by Mr. Sibal, on the fact that, while \nthe grounds for refusal of registration envisaged by Section 9 were \n―absolute grounds‖ those envisaged by Section 11 were ―relative \ngrounds‖.  His submission is that ―relative grounds‖ would refer to \ngrounds which consider the mark, of which registration is being \nsought, in relation to some other mark. Adverting specifically to \nSection 11(3)(a), Mr. Sibal seeks to submit that the words ―by virtue \nof any law‖ with which the said provision commences, have to be \nread in the context of Section 11  as a whole and also noscitur a sociis \nwith the words ―law of passing off‖ and the ―law of copyright‖ which \nfind place in Clauses (a) and (b) of Section 11(3).

Mr. Anand contends, per contra, that the words ―by virtue of \nany law‖ are wide and all encompassing. The mere fact that the law of \npassing off has been particularized after the said expression in Section \n11(3)(a) cannot, in his submission, narrow the sweep and ambit of the \nwords ―any law‖. ―Any law‖, in Mr. Anand‘s submission, would refer \nprecisely to ―any law‖, meaning any law in force for the time being in \nIndia.  The Geneva Convention Act is also, therefore, according to \nhim, one of the laws which would stand embraced by the expression \n―any law‖ as used in Section 11(3)(a).   \n \n111. I must confess that the submissions of Mr. Anand did initially \nappeal to me.  On a deeper analysis of Section 11, however, I find \nmyself in agreement with Mr. Sibal. \n \n112. Section 11(3)(a), I may note, is a very unhappily worded \nprovision.  It is lacking in precision, which is one of the most essential \nattributes of good legislation.

Paras 65 to 68 of the report \nread thus: \n ―65.  We find that the High Court has failed to take into \nconsideration two important principles of interpretation. The first \none being of textual and contextual interpretation. It will be \napposite to refer to the guiding principles, succinctly summed up \nby Chinnappa Reddy, J., in the judgment of this Court in  \nRBI v. Peerless General Finance & Investment Co. Ltd.50: \n \n―33.  \nInterpretation must depend on the text and the \ncontext. They are the bases of interpretation. One may well \nsay if the text is the texture, context is what gives the \ncolour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That \ninterpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation \nmatch the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we \nknow why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute \nmust be read, first as a whole and then section by section, \nclause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a \nstatute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the \nglasses of the statute-maker, provided by such context, its \nscheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take \ncolour and appear different than when the statute is looked \nat without the glasses provided by the context. With these \nglasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover \nwhat each section, each clause, each phrase and each word \nis meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the \nentire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can \nbe construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so \nthat every word has a place and everything is in its place. It \nis by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting of \nthe entire Act and by reference to what preceded the \nenactment and the reasons for it that the court construed the \nexpression \n―Prize \nChit‖ \nin Srinivasa \nEnterprises v. U.O.I.51, and we find no reason to depart \nfrom the court's construction.‖ \n \n66.  \nIt is thus trite law that while interpreting the provisions of a \nstatute, it is necessary that the textual interpretation should be \nmatched with the contextual one. The Act must be looked at as a \nwhole and it must be discovered what each section, each clause, \neach phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit \ninto the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word \nof a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be \nconstrued so that every word has a place and everything is in its \nplace.

One of the purposes for which the said Act has been \nenacted is prohibiting the use of someone else's trade mark as a \npart of the corporate name or the name of business concern. If the \nentire scheme of the Act is construed as a whole, it provides for the \nrights conferred by registration and the right to sue for \ninfringement of the registered trade mark by its proprietor. The \nlegislative scheme as enacted under the said statute elaborately \nprovides for the eventualities in which a proprietor of the \nregistered trade mark can bring an action for infringement of the \ntrade mark and the limits on effect of the registered trade mark. By \npicking up a part of the provisions in sub-section (4) of Section 29 \nof the said Act and a part of the provision in sub-section (1) of \nSection 30 of the said Act and giving it a textual meaning without \nconsidering the context in which the said provisions have to be \nconstrued, in our view, would not be permissible. We are at pains \nto say that the High Court fell in error in doing so. \n \n67.  \nAnother principle that the High Court has failed to notice is \nthat a part of a section cannot be read in isolation. This Court, \nspeaking through A.P. Sen, J., in Balasinor Nagrik Coop. Bank \nLtd. v. Babubhai Shankerlal Pandya52, observed thus :  \n \n―4. … It is an elementary rule that construction of a section \nis to be made of all parts together. It is not permissible to \nomit any part of it. For, the principle that the statute must \nbe read as a whole is equally applicable to different parts \nof the same section.‖ \n \nThis \nprinciple \nwas \nreiterated \nby \nthis \nCourt \nin Kalawatibai v. Soiryabai53: \n \n―6. … It is well settled that a section has to be read in its \nentirety as one composite unit without bifurcating it or \nignoring any part of it.” \n \n68.  \nIgnoring this principle, the High Court has picked up clause \n(c) of sub-section (4) of Section 29 of the said Act in isolation \nwithout even noticing the other provisions contained in the said \nsub-section (4) of Section 29 of the said Act. Similarly, again \nwhile considering the import of sub-section (1) of Section 30 of the \nsaid Act, the High Court has only picked up clause (b) of sub-\nsection (1) of Section 30 of the said Act, ignoring the provisions \ncontained in clause (a) of the said sub-section (1) of Section 30 of \nthe said Act.‖ \n(Emphasis supplied) \n                                          \n52 (1987) 1 SCC 606 \n53 (1991) 3 SCC 410 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

The sub-section \nclarifies that, within the ambit of ―confusion‖ would be included the \nlikelihood of association with the earlier trade mark.   \n \n120. Section 11(2) protects earlier ―well-known trade marks‖, within \nthe meaning of Section 2(1)(zg)55 of the Trade Marks Act. Where an \nearlier trade mark is a well-known trade mark within the said \ndefinition, a later trade mark, which is identical or similar to the \nearlier trade mark, cannot be registered, if the use of such later mark \nwould take unfair advantage of, or be detrimental to the distinctive \ncharacter or repute of, the earlier well-known trade mark.  \n \n121.

All proscriptions against registration of a trade mark, in Section \n11, therefore, refer to handicaps on registration in the light of earlier \nexisting intellectual property.  Clearly, they are intended at protecting \nexisting intellectual property, essentially either from infringement or \nfrom passing off.    \n \n123.

No \noccasion arises, therefore, under Section 9, to refer to any other mark.  \nMr. Sibal is, therefore, correct in his submission that the likelihood of \ndeception and confusion envisaged by Section 9(2)(a), too, has to be \nan attribute of the mark itself and seen on its own, and not in \ncomparison with, or vis-à-vis, any other mark.  It is for this reason that \nthe clause employs the expression ―by its very nature‖.   \n \n124.

The right to refuse registration of a mark under \nSection 11(3), therefore, is subject to the pre-condition envisaged by \nSection 11(5) applying.  It is only where the proprietor of an earlier \ntrade mark objects to registration of the proposed mark on one of the \ngrounds envisaged by Sections 11(2) and 11(3), in appropriate \nopposition proceedings, that registration of a mark can be refused \nunder either of the said provisions.  \n \n128. This places the matter beyond pale of doubt.  The pre-condition \nfor Sections 11(2) and 11 (3) to apply, as statutorily engrafted in \nSection 11(5), requires an opposition by a proprietor of an earlier \ntrade mark.  The proprietor of the earlier trade mark has, therefore, to \nobject to registration of the proposed mark on the ground (i) that it is \nidentical with or similar to an earlier well-known trade mark, (ii) the \nuse of the mark in India is liable to be prevented by any law, in \nparticular the law of passing off or (iii) the use of the mark in India is \nliable to be prevented by the law of copyright.  \n \n129. The legislative intent, clearly, is to balance the right of an \napplicant seeking registration of the later mark, with the intellectual \nproperty rights which vest in the proprietor of the earlier mark.    \n \n130. This conclusion is also supported by the use of the particular \narticle ―the‖ used in the expression ―the earlier trade mark‖ in Section \n11(5).  The use of the article ―the‖ indicates that all proscriptions in \nSections 11(5) (2) and (3) are intended to apply to proprietorial rights \nvesting in the proprietor of an earlier trade mark.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

Trade Mark Registry & Anr.pdf\" in approximately 200 words:\n\nThe High Court of Delhi at New Delhi was considering an appeal from Armasuisse (Appellant) against the Registrar of Trademarks' decision to refuse registration of its mark. On page 67, the court was interpreting Section 11(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, which allows refusal of registration if it is contrary to any law in force in India.\n\nThe court ruled that the words \"any law\" in Section 11(3)(a) cannot be understood as referring to every law in force in India. If so, it would make the provision absolute and illogical, as it would restrict the right to object to registration only to proprietors of earlier trade marks (Section 11(5)). The court also considered Renaissance Hotels Holdings v. Portman Resorts Group  (para 66-68), which reinforced that the sweep of Section 11(3)(a) must be restricted to laws impacting proprietorial rights.\n\nThe words \"by virtue of any law\" in Section 11(3)(a) cannot be extended to every applicable law in India, but only to those affecting proprietary rights. This interpretation is based on a reading of the section in conjunction with Section 9 and other provisions of Section 11.\n\n(PDF source: Armasuisse v. Trade Mark Registry & Anr.",

The words ―any law‖, as employed in Section 11(3)(a), would \nalso, therefore, have to be understood in this background. They cannot \nbe understood as referring to any law in force in India, which has \nnothing to do with intellectual property rights vesting in the proprietor \nof any earlier mark.  \n \n132. As Mr. Sibal correctly submits, if the word ―any law‖, finding \nplace in Section 11(3)(a) is to embrace all laws in force in India, the \nproscription would cease to be ―relative‖, and would become \n―absolute‖.  It would, then, appropriately have to find place in Section \n9, not in Section 11.  Additionally, if such were the interpretation, it \nwould be illogical to restrict the right to object to registration, on that \nground, only to proprietors of earlier trade marks, as Section 11(5) \nordains.  The fact that Section 11(3) applies only where an objection \nto registration, on the grounds envisaged in the said sub-sections, is \nraised by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark, indicates that the \nprovision does not envisage an absolute ground to refuse registration, \nbut envisages, instead, an objection predicated on the prejudice \nsuffered by the intellectual property rights of the proprietor of the \nearlier trade mark.   \n \n133.

Despite a specific recommendation, \nin the Debates, to further elaborate Clause 11(3)(a) of the Trade \nMarks Bill – which metamorphosed into Section 11(3)(a) of the Trade \nMarks Act after Presidential sanction – to protect India‘s \ncommitments under the Universal and Berne Copyright Conventions, \nand its obligations under the TRIPS agreement, these suggestions \nwere never acted upon.

I have held, earlier, that the words ―any law‖, in Section \n11(3)(a) cannot extend to statutes which do not involve considerations \nof intellectual property rights of others and that, therefore, the Geneva \nConventions Act does not fall within the parenthetic embrace of the \nphrase ―any law‖.  But what if the use of the mark, of which \nregistration is sought, is absolutely proscribed by some other law, as \nthe German Conventions Act does in the present case, according to \nMr. Anand?  Can the Registrar register a mark the use of which stands \nstatutorily proscribed elsewhere? \n \n138. The answer, in my view, has to be in the affirmative.  The \nRegistrar of Trade Marks is appointed under Section 3(1)56 of the \nTrade Marks Act, and the learned Deputy Registrar, who has passed \nthe impugned order, has apparently been empowered to do so by the \nAct.  In either case, the appointment of the officer is ―for the purposes \nof this Act‖.  In M.A. Kochu Devassy v.

The above conclusion would stand fortified even by Section 12 \nof the Geneva Conventions Act itself.  What Section 12 proscribes is \nuse of the heraldic emblem of the Swiss confederation.  There is a \nstatutory distinction between registration and use of a trade mark.  \nUse follows registration.  Section 28(1)60 of the Trade Marks Act \nmakes this clear.  The proprietor of a registered trade mark is, by \nSection 28(1), invested with the right to use it.  Section 12 of the \nGeneva Conventions Act, therefore, affects, if at all, the right to use \nthe mark, not the right to have it registered.  The right to registration \nstands circumscribed by the Trade Marks Act, which remains a \ncomplete code in that regard.  If the right to use the mark, once \nregistered, is subject to some other statutory proscription, that \nproscription operates outside the peripheries of the Trade Marks Act.  \nIf such a proscription exists, and the proprietor of the trade mark \nviolates it, the violation may well invite sanctions as envisaged by the \nproscribing statute.  The right to registration of the mark is unaffected \nby any such proscription.  The learned Deputy Registrar, and, \nconsequently, this Court which is sitting in appeal over the decision of \nthe learned Deputy Registrar, is not required to venture into that \nterritory, as it is concerned only with the entitlement of the impugned \nmark to registration, and not to the entitlement of Respondent 2 to use \nthe mark, once registered if at all.   \n \n142. To my knowledge, there does not exist, outside the Trade \nMarks Act, any proscription against registration of a trade mark.  Nor \nhas Mr. Anand invited my attention to any such proscription. \n                                          \n60 28.  \nRights conferred by registration. –  \n(1)  \nSubject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, \ngive to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in \nrelation to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief \nin respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:04.01.2023\n15:28:31\nSignature Not Verified",

Though the point was raised \nbefore the learned Deputy Registrar, albeit in written submissions \nafter conclusion of hearing, no reply, to the point, was provided by \nRespondent 2.  The point has again been urged in these proceedings \nby the appellant, and the only explanation forthcoming, from \nRespondent 2, is that it was a feature of the software used by it.  The \nreply is thoroughly unsatisfactory.

The submission, of Respondent 2, that the contention was \nirrelevant as it had applied for the impugned mark on a ―proposed to \nbe used‖ basis is obviously without merit.  Submission of a fabricated \ndocument for having a mark registered would ipso facto disentitle the \napplicant to registration.  The matter cannot be wished away by \nreferring to any number of other invoices which Respondent 2 might \nhave submitted in support of its application for registration.  One \nsingle fabricated document is itself sufficient to reject the application.  \nNo benefit, in law, can enure in favour of a fabricator.

Section 9(2)(a) uses the words ―of such nature as to deceive the \npublic or cause confusion‖.  I have already held that the impugned \nmark, when used in a red-and-white colour format, is of such nature as \nto confuse the public into linking the goods, on which the mark \nfigures, with Switzerland; in other words, of presuming the goods to \nbe of Swiss origin.   \n \n153. This impression is not attributable solely to the red-and-white \ncolour scheme of the mark.  The words ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ have a \nlarge part to play in the impression that the mark would carry.  It \nwould be folly to analogize a mark such as ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ \nwith a mark such as, for example, ‗PETER ENGLAND‘ which, as a \nphrase has no etymological meaning at all, so that it it becomes \ninstantly fanciful, and can, therefore, be kept out of the reckoning.  \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘, however, conjures up an instant mental \npicture of the Swiss military establishment.  A mental connection with \nSwitzerland is, therefore, inevitably made.  That, by itself, satisfies the \nrequirement of ―causing confusion‖ envisaged by Section 9(2)(a).   \n \n154. The Slazenger38 principle would also equally apply here.   \nThere is no explanation for the adoption, by Respondent 2, of the \n‗SWISS MILITARY‘ moniker.  The use of the word ‗MILITARY‘ is \nseriously prejudicial to the case of Respondent 2.  It is not a word \nlightly used, or, for that matter, to be lightly used.

Being such an unusual use, the mark is \nbound, in the perception of the ordinary consumer, to suggest a link to \nthe Swiss official establishment; and, perhaps, even to the Swiss \nmilitary establishment. In the absence of any material to suggest that \nthere was an absolute embargo on the Swiss military establishment \nusing the ‗SWISS MILITARY‘ appellation on goods put up for \ntrade, the learned Deputy Registrar was not, in my view, justified in \npresuming that persons would never connect the goods, on which the \nmark figures, with the Swiss military establishment. \n \n155. If, for example, backpacks bearing the words ‗INDIAN AIR \nFORCE‘ were to be seen by persons outside India, it is obvious, to my \nmind, that they would presume a link with the Indian Air Force, \nwhether the words were, or were not, accompanied by the official \nIndian Air Force insignia.  The words ‗INDIAN AIR FORCE‘, like \nthe words ―‗SWISS MILITARY‘ carry their own solemn \nconnotation.

The use of the ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ appellation, even by itself and sans any accompanying \nembellishments or emblems, has the clear propensity of creating \nconfusion in the mind of the public, regarding the origin of the goods \non which the mark is used.  The ―confusion factor‖ is the use of the \nappellation ‗SWISS MILITARY‘, and not a black and white cross, \nthough the use of the black and white cross may add to the confusion.  \nSection 9(2)(a) would, therefore, apply even if the mark ‗SWISS \nMILITARY‘ is used without the accompanying black and white \ncross.    \n \nConclusion \n \n163.
