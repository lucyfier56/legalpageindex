    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary**\n\n**C.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 8/2021**\n**NEW NATION NETWORKS PRIVATE LIMITED v. THE REGISTRAR OF TRADEMARKS**\n\n**Background:**\nThe appellant, News Nation Networks Private Limited, filed an application (Application No. 2833066) with the Registrar of Trademarks seeking registration of the trade mark \"NEWS NATION\" for broadcasting services through various modes and means. The applicant sought to register the mark under Classes 35 and 38.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n1. Whether the mark \"NEWS NATION\" possesses distinctive character and is capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods/services from those of other traders.\n2. Whether the registration of an identical mark for similar services in other states would not be permissible.\n\n**Arguments:**\nThe learned counsel for the appellant, Mr. Manish Dhir, argued that:\n\n1. The Registrar erred in refusing registration of the mark on the ground that it lacked distinctive character. He cited examples of identical marks (NEWSFIRST and NEWSTALK) registered by the same Registrar for similar services.\n2. The rejection was discriminatory as no explanation was offered to justify the inconsistent treatment.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\n1. The learned Single Judge of the High Court noted that the ground of rejection relied on by the Registrar, namely lack of distinctive character, had been rejected in other cases where identical marks were registered for similar services.\n2. The court applied the principle of consistency set out in _Joy v. Regional Transport Authority_ (1998 SCC OnLine Ker 344), holding that judicial authorities should maintain consistency even in rendering judgments with contradictory views.\n\n**Decision:**\nIn view of the inconsistent treatment and lack of justification offered by the Registrar, the learned Single Judge allowed the appellant's appeal, setting aside the impugned order dated June 22, 2020. The application (Application No. 2833066) for registration of the mark \"NEWS NATION\" for broadcasting services was also allowed.",
