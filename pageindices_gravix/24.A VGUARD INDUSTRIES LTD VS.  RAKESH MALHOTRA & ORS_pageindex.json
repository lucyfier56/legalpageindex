    "decision_summary": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the case:\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe plaintiff, V-Guard Industries Ltd., filed two lawsuits against defendants Rakesh Malhotra and Vave India Energy Solutions Private Limited claiming that they had infringed on their trade marks \"V-GUARD\" and \"LIVGUARD\", respectively. The lawsuits were CS(COMM) 1018/2016 and CS(COMM) 814/2018.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\nThe main legal issue in this case was whether the defendants' use of the trade mark \"LIVGUARD\" was deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark \"V-GUARD\". The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's mark was a trademark infringement and sought permanent injunction restraining the defendants from passing off their goods.\n\n**History of Litigation:**\n\nThe parties have had a long history of litigation relating to their competing trademarks. In OS no. 12/2013, filed by the plaintiff alleging trademark infringement against Rakesh Malhotra (now defendant no.1 in CS(COMM) 1018/2016), an ex parte injunction was granted restraining him from using the trade mark \"LIVGUARD\". However, this was later vacated and the interim application was dismissed holding that there is no similarity between the plaintiff's trademark \"V-GUARD\" and the defendant's trademark \"LIVGUARD\".\n\n**Arguments:**\n\nThe defendants filed two applications under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) for stay of the present suits till the disposal of the appeal bearing no. RFA 117/2017 before the Kerala High Court.\n\nThe senior counsel for the plaintiff stated that no reply was required to be filed to the aforesaid applications, while the defendants argued that there is no similarity between the plaintiff's trademark \"V-GUARD\" and their trade mark \"LIVGUARD\", as held by the District Court, Ernakulam and later reinforced by the Kerala High Court.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nThe court found that:\n\n1.  The defendant's application for stay was maintainable under Section 10 of CPC.\n2.  The court considered that the appeal before the Kerala High Court would have significant bearing on this case, particularly as the judgment in OS no. 12/2013 (which had ex parte injunction initially granted) is pending before the High Court.\n3.  The plaintiff has already approached the Kerala High Court and obtained dismissal of their SLP, and therefore it was considered just that the proceedings in Delhi should also be stayed.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe court granted a stay to the present suits CS(COMM) 1018/2016 and CS(COMM) 814/2018 till disposal of appeal bearing no. RFA 117/2017 filed by the plaintiff before the Kerala High Court against the judgment and decree dated 22nd November, 2016 passed by the Additional District Judge, Ernakulam in OS No. 12/2013.\n\nThis order gives an impression that defendant's trademark \"LIVGUARD\" was not considered to be deceptively similar to V-GUARD, which is a subject matter of ongoing litigation in Kerala High Court. \n\nDecision of this case has been stayed till Kerala High Court decides case RFA 117/2017 so final decision remains pending.\n\nPlease note that the findings and reasoning mentioned above are based on the given text, but might not reflect the full understanding or nuances present in a detailed judgment document.",

The ex parte injunction order was vacated and the \ninterim application filed on behalf of the plaintiff was dismissed by \nthe District Court, Ernakulam vide order dated 1st June, 2013 holding \nthat there is no similarity between the plaintiff‟s trademark “V-\nGUARD” and the defendant‟s trademark “LIVGUARD”. \nIII. \nAn appeal was filed by the plaintiff against the aforesaid order dated \n1st June, 2013 before the Kerala High Court, which was dismissed by \nthe Kerala High Court vide judgment dated 5th July, 2013, by holding \nthat the defendant‟s trademark “LIVGUARD” is not similar to the \nplaintiff‟s trademark “V-GUARD”. \nIV. \nThe SLP, bearing no. 36230/2013, filed on behalf of the plaintiff \nagainst the aforesaid judgment dated 5th July, 2013, was dismissed as \nwithdrawn on 22nd November, 2013. \nV. \nAn application was filed on behalf of the plaintiff before the District \nCourt, Ernakulam seeking withdrawal of OS no. 12/2013 insofar as it \nrelated to the relief of passing off with liberty to file the same in a \nCourt of competent jurisdiction, which was allowed on 24th \nNovember, 2015. \nVI. \nPursuant to the aforesaid liberty, CS(COMM) 1018/2016 was filed on \nbehalf of the plaintiff before this Court. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 4 of 19 \n \nVII. \nAfter the trial, a final judgment and decree was passed by the District \nCourt, Ernakulam, dismissing the suit filed by the plaintiff on 22nd \nNovember, 2016. \nVIII. \nAgainst the aforesaid dismissal, the plaintiff filed an appeal, bearing \nno. RFA 117/2017 before the Kerala High Court, which appeal is \nstated to be pending. \nIX. \nOn 16th August, 2017, issues were framed in CS(COMM) 1018/2016 \nand it was recorded that no oral evidence is required to be led and that \nthe suit would be decided on the basis of the pleadings of the parties. \nX. \nSubsequently, an application, being I.A.10323/2017 in CS(COMM) \n1018/2016 was filed on behalf of the plaintiff seeking leave to lead \nevidence. The said application was disposed of as not pressed on 1st \nFebruary, 2018 and liberty was granted to the plaintiff to file a suit on \nany cause of action that was not the subject matter of CS(COMM) \n1018/2016. \nXI. \nOn 19th April, 2018, the plaintiff filed a fresh suit being CS(COMM) \n814/2018 against Shri Rakesh Malhotra, SAR Group (defendant no.3) \nand Vave India Energy Solutions Pvt.

The District Court, Ernakulam as well as the Kerala High Court have \nboth returned findings that there is no similarity between the marks of \nthe plaintiff and the defendant. Reliance in this regard is placed on (i) \nthe order dated 1st June, 2013 passed by the District Court, Ernakulam \nwhile dismissing the interim application of the plaintiff; (ii) order \ndated 5th July, 2013 passed by the Kerala High Court while dismissing \nthe appeal filed by the plaintiff against the order dated 1st June, 2013 \npassed by the District Court, Ernakulam and (iii) the judgment and \ndecree dated 22nd November, 2016 passed by the District Court, \nErnakulam. \nII. Since, the issues to be determined in both the present suits are with \nregard to similarity between the marks of the plaintiff and the \ndefendants and the subject matter of the present suits is directly and \nsubstantially the same as in the suit filed by the plaintiff before the \nDistrict Court, Ernakulam and the appeal pending before the Kerala \nHigh Court, the present suits liable to be stayed till the appeal filed by \nthe plaintiff is finally decided.  \nIII. Reliance is placed on: \na) The judgment of a four Judge Bench in Manohar Lal Chopra v. \nRai Bahadur Rao Raja Set Hiralal, 1962 Supp (1) SCR 450. The \njudgment of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in H.S. SAHNI v. \nMukul Singhal, (2022) 1 HCC (Del) 155 to submit that provisions \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 6 of 19 \n \nof Section 10 of the CPC are mandatory and the objective behind \nSection 10 of the CPC is to avoid possibility of contradictory \nverdicts by two Courts in respect of the same relief.  \nb) The judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Romesh \nKumar Bhatia v. Zorrik Enterprises, 1980 SCC OnLine Del 202, \nwhere in similar circumstances, this Court had stayed a suit \npending before this Court on the ground that a similar earlier suit \nwas filed before the District Court.  \nc) The judgment of the Supreme Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. \nZamindara Engineering Co., (1969) 2 SCC 727 to contend that \nboth, for the purposes of infringement and for passing off, same \ntest has to be applied by the Court with regard to likelihood of \nconfusion or deception arising from similarity of marks. \n7. \nPer contra, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff has \nmade the following submissions: \nI. \nThe aforesaid applications have been filed belatedly only when the \nsuits were set for final hearing. \nII. \nFor a suit to be stayed under Section 10 of the CPC, the subject matter \nin both the suits have to be identical. Reliance in this regard is placed \non the judgment of the Supreme Court in National Institute of \nMental Health & Neuro Sciences v. C. Parameshwara, (2005) 2 \nSCC 256. \nIII. \nThe reliefs of passing off and infringement are arising from entirely \ndifferent causes of action and therefore, it cannot be said that the \nsubject matters in issue in the two suits are directly and substantially \nthe same.

Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1240 and Pernod Ricard \nIndia (P) Ltd. v. Frost Falcon Distilleries Ltd., 2022 SCC OnLine \nDel 646. \nIV. \nThe Section 10 is merely a rule of procedure and the Courts are not \nbound by the same. Reliance is placed on the judgment of the \nSupreme Court in Pukhraj D. Jain And Ors. v. G. Gopalakrishna \n(2004) 7 SCC 251.  \nV. \nFor provisions of Section 10 of the CPC to apply, the Court in which \nearlier suit has been filed has to be a Court with competent \njurisdiction to decide the said suit. In the present case, the District \nCourt, Ernakulam did not have the territorial jurisdiction in respect of \nthe claim of the plaintiff for passing off and therefore, the bar under \nSection 10 would not apply. Reliance is placed on the order passed by \nthe Kerala High Court on 24th November, 2015, whereby the plaintiff \nhas been allowed to withdraw its claim in so far as the relief of \npassing off is concerned, with liberty to file it before a competent \nCourt. Reliance is placed on the judgment in Bristol-Myers Squibb \nHoldings Ireland Unlimited Company And Ors. v. Natco Pharma, \n2020 SCC OnLine Del 200. \nVI. \nThe Section 10 of the CPC only envisages a stay of the trial and the \nsame cannot apply to the present suit, where it has been recorded that \nno evidence is to be recorded and the suit has been set for final \nhearing. \n8. \n  In rejoinder, senior counsel on behalf of the defendants has made the \nfollowing submissions: \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 8 of 19 \n \nI. \nThere is no delay on the part of the defendants in filing the present \napplication. The present application was filed immediately after the \nissues were framed in CS(COMM) 814/2018 on 6th March, 2019. \nII. \nThe word „jurisdiction‟ used in Section 10 of the CPC is not in \nrelation to territorial jurisdiction of the Court but in the context of \ninherent jurisdiction. It cannot be denied that the District Court, \nErnakulam, Kochi had the inherent jurisdiction to entertain a suit for \npassing off. Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment of the \nKarnataka High Court in Channabasappa Kamadal & Sons v. \nKishan Chand & Co. & Anr., 1971 SCC OnLine Kar 182. \nIII. \nIt is wrong to contend that the word „trial‟ in Section 10 of the CPC is \nconfined to the recording of evidence in the suit. The term „trial‟ \nincludes the final hearing of the suit as well. \n9. \nI have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record. \n10. \nI do not find any merit in the submissions made on behalf of the \nplaintiff that the present applications have been filed belatedly only to delay \nthe final adjudication of the suit. CS(COMM) 814/2018 was filed on behalf \nof the plaintiff only on 19th April, 2018 and issues were framed therein on 6th \nMarch, 2019 and it was directed that both the suits were to be heard \ntogether. The present applications were filed on behalf of the defendants on \n1st July, 2019. Therefore, it cannot be said that there was a delay in filing the \npresent applications.  \n11. \nAs far back in 1962, the four Judge Bench in the Manohar Lal \nChopra (supra) has held that the provisions of Section 10 of the CPC are \nclear, definite and mandatory, and the Court in which the subsequent suit \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 9 of 19 \n \nhas been filed is prohibited from proceeding with the trial of the suit if the \nparameters of Section 10 of the CPC are fulfilled.  \n12. \nRelying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Aspi Jal v. \nKhushroo Rustom Dadyburjor, (2013) 4 SCC 333, a Co-ordinate Bench of \nthis Court in H.S. SAHNI (supra) has reiterated the position that provision \nof Section 10 of the CPC is mandatory in nature. The relevant observations \nin H.S. SAHNI (supra) are set out below: \n“22. \nEven in Aspi Jal (supra), which is relied upon by the \nlearned senior counsel for the plaintiff, the Supreme Court has \nreiterated that the use of the negative expression in Section 10 \nCPC makes the provision mandatory and the court in which the \nsubsequent suit has been filed is prohibited from proceeding with \nthe trial of that suit. It was reaffirmed that the basic purpose and \nthe underlying object of Section 10 of the Code is to prevent the \ncourts \nof \nconcurrent \njurisdiction \nfrom \nsimultaneously \nentertaining and adjudicating upon two parallel litigations in \nrespect of same cause of action, same subject matter and the \nsame relief. The objective is also to avoid the possibility of \ncontradictory verdicts by two courts in respect of the same relief \nand is aimed to protect the defendant from multiplicity of \nproceedings.  \n \n23. \nThe fundamental test that is to be applied to determine \nwhether Section 10 was applicable or not, is to see whether on \nthe final decision being reached in the first suit, such decision \nwould operate as res-judicata in the subsequent suit. Where there \nwas “identity of matter” in both the suits i.e., the whole of the \nsubject matter in both the proceedings were identical, even if \nfurther reliefs were claimed in the subsequent suit, it would be \nimmaterial and the second suit would necessarily have to be \nstayed.”  \n \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 10 of 19 \n \n13. \nThe appeal against the aforesaid judgment, being FAO(OS) (COMM) \n70/2022, was dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court vide order dated \n11th November, 2022. \n14. \nIn Romesh Kumar Bhatia (supra) a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court \nwas seized of a similar issue. In the said case, a suit was filed by the plaintiff \nbefore an Additional District Judge based on the claim of passing off and the \nsaid suit was dismissed. An appeal against the said dismissal was pending \nbefore the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal, a suit for \ninfringement of registered trade mark was filed by the plaintiffs. One of the \nissues framed in the infringement suit was whether the said suit was liable to \nbe stayed. While considering the issue of grant of stay under Section 10 of \nthe CPC, the following observations were made: \n“17. \nThe question that therefore, arises is whether an \nindependent and different finding on the matter of deception \nand conclusion can be given in this suit. This will be \ninescapable as no relief can be granted to the plaintiffs unless it \nis held that the use of the word “Zorrik” by the defendants \nresults in deception and confusion so as to infringe the trade \nmark of the plaintiffs. \n \nXXX \n \n \n \nXXX  \n \n \n \nXXX \n \n22. \nWith this state of law, there is no escape from the \nconclusion that as long as the finding of the Additional District \nJudge in the earlier suit that the sale of ties by the defendants \nunder the mark “Zorrik” does not result in deception and \nconfusion with the consumers in the market so as to identify them \nas those of the plaintiffs stands, no relief whatsoever can be \ngranted to the plaintiffs in the present suit. The proper course \nfor the plaintiffs, therefore, is to pursue their remedy in the \nappeal now pending in the High Court. The subject-matter in \nthe present suit to this extent, therefore, must be held as directly \nand substantially similar to that involved in that appeal.

It is not necessary that the subject matter \nand cause of action in two suits should be identical. Where \nthere is substantial identity between matters in dispute in earlier \nand later suits, the final decision in the earlier suit would \noperate as binding in the subsequent suit. It is also immaterial \nthat different reliefs are claimed, in case the matters in issue in \nthe two suits are substantially the same. (See in this respect AIR \n1973 Madras 473, in Shorab Merwanji Modi v. Mansata Film \nDistributors, AIR 1957 Calcutta 727, in Guruswami Asari v. \nRaju Asari.” \n \n15. \nThe aforesaid legal principles and particularly, the aforesaid \nobservations in Romesh Kumar Bhatia (supra) as set out above are squarely \napplicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case.  \n16. \nIn the suit filed before the District Court, Ernakulam, the following \nissue was framed as issue no.3: \n“3. Is the trademark „LIVGUARD‟ identical with or deceptively \nsimilar to the trademark „V-GUARD‟?” \n \n17. \nThe District Court, Ernakulam, after a detailed discussion gave a \nfinding that the aforesaid marks of the plaintiff and the defendants are not \ndeceptively similar. The conclusion as set out in paragraph 43 of the \njudgment dated 22nd November, 2016 is set out below:  \n“43. \nTo conclude, what is revealed is that on scores of \nphonetic similarity, visual similarity, similarity of the nature of \npresentation like words similarity and label similarity, and other \ngiven scores of comparison, as revealed from the law trite on the \npoint discussed supra, the plaintiff is not able to establish that \neither the marks are similar or even deceptively similar. Issue \nno.3 is, therefore, found against the plaintiff. It necessarily \nfollows that both marks shall not go to create any confusion in \nthe mindsets of those intended purchasers buying these products \nfrom the often market. This is answer to Issue number 4.” \n \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 12 of 19 \n \n18. \nAdmittedly, an appeal has been filed by the plaintiff against the \naforesaid judgment dated 22nd November, 2016, which is pending \nadjudication before the Kerala High Court. \n19. \nIn the amended plaint filed by the plaintiff in CS(COMM) 1018/2016, \nthe case set up by the plaintiff is that the wordmark “LIVGUARD” is \nconfusingly visually, structurally, phonetically and deceptively similar to the \nplaintiff‟s mark “V-GUARD”. Reference in this regard may be made to \nparagraphs 2A, 2C and 2K of the amended plaint. Based on the above, a \ndecree of permanent injunction is sought against the defendants restraining \nthe defendants from passing off the defendants‟ goods as that of the \nplaintiff‟s on the ground of the defendants‟ mark “LIVGUARD” being \ndeceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s mark “V-GUARD”. \n20. \nIssues were framed in CS(COMM) 1018/2016 on 16th August, 2017. \nReference may be made to issues no.1 and 4, which are set out below: \n“1. \nWhether defendants' adoption and use of the mark \n\"Livguard\" amounts to passing off of, goods as those originating \nfrom the plaintiff?  \n \n \n \n \n \nOPP \nXXX \n \n \n \nXXX  \n \n \n \nXXX \n \n4. \nWhether use of defendant's mark \"Livguard\" word per se \nand/ or as it is being actually used, does not amount to passing \noff as plaintiff s mark?  \n \n \n \n \n        OPD” \n \n21. \nIn CS(COMM) 814/2018, the plaintiff has sought an injunction \nagainst the defendants in respect of defendants passing off the \nplaintiffs‟ trade dress.

Issues were framed in the \nsaid suit on 6th March, 2019. A reference may be made to the following \nissues: \n“(i) Whether the trade dress of the defendants is similar / deceptively \nsimilar to the trade dress of the plaintiff?  \n \n \nOPP. \n \n(ii) Whether the cumulative effect of the use of the trade dress along \nwith trade mark by the defendants amounts to the defendants passing \noff their goods as that of the plaintiff?  \n \n \nOPP.” \n \n22. \nOn 6th March, 2019, the Court also made an observation that the \noutcome of the suit would be governed only on a comparison of the \ntwo marks, whether there is any similarity/ dissimilarity between the \ntwo marks. \n23. \nThe intent behind Section 10 of the CPC is to prevent Courts of \nconcurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously deciding suits between the same \nparties, involving directly and substantially the same cause of action. The \nobjective is based on the principle of judicial comity and to avoid two \ncontradictory verdicts by Courts of competent jurisdiction.   \n24. \nA reading of the judgment and decree dated 22nd November, 2016, \npassed by the District Court, Ernakulam, the pleadings in the present suits \nand the issues framed herein, leaves no doubt in my mind that the issues that \nhave to be adjudicated in the present suits, were subject matter of the suit \nbefore the District Court, Ernakulam, and a definite finding has been given \nin the said suit. The finding given by the District Court, Ernakulam that \nthere is no phonetic or visual similarity between the trademarks of the \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 14 of 19 \n \nplaintiff and the defendant, constitutes res judicata and is binding on the \nplaintiff and in light of the aforesaid finding, no relief can be granted to the \nplaintiffs in the present suit. Therefore, in my considered view the subject \nmatter of the present suits is directly and substantially identical to the \nsubject matter of the suit before the District Court, Ernakulam, and is now \nthe subject matter of an appeal pending before the Kerala High Court. It is to \nbe noted that no submission has been made on behalf of the plaintiff to the \neffect that the issues to be determined in the present suits and the suit before \nthe District Court, Eranakulam are not directly and substantially the same.  \nTherefore, if the present suits are permitted to proceed, there could be a \npossibility of conflicting judgments in respect of similar issues between the \nsame parties.   \n25. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on National Institute of \nMental Health & Neuro Sciences (supra)  to contend that for a suit to be \nstayed under Section 10 of the CPC, the subject matter in both the suits have \nto be identical. Paragraph 8 of the aforesaid judgment relied upon by the \nplaintiff is set out below: \n“8.  The object underlying Section 10 is to prevent courts of \nconcurrent jurisdiction from simultaneously trying two parallel \nsuits in respect of the same matter in issue. The object underlying \nSection 10 is to avoid two parallel trials on the same issue by two \ncourts and to avoid recording of conflicting findings on issues \nwhich are directly and substantially in issue in previously \ninstituted suit. The language of Section 10 suggests that it is \nreferable to a suit instituted in the civil court and it cannot apply \nto proceedings of other nature instituted under any other statute. \nThe object of Section 10 is to prevent courts of concurrent \njurisdiction from simultaneously trying two parallel suits \nbetween the same parties in respect of the same matter in issue. \nThe fundamental test to attract Section 10 is, whether on final \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 15 of 19 \n \ndecision being reached in the previous suit, such decision would \noperate as res judicata in the subsequent suit. Section 10 applies \nonly in cases where the whole of the subject-matter in both the \nsuits is identical. The key words in Section 10 are “the matter in \nissue is directly and substantially in issue” in the previous \ninstituted suit. The words “directly and substantially in issue” \nare used in contradistinction to the words “incidentally or \ncollaterally in issue”. Therefore, Section 10 would apply only if \nthere is identity of the matter in issue in both the suits, meaning \nthereby, that the whole of the subject-matter in both the \nproceedings is identical.” \n \n26. \nAs can be seen from the extract quoted above, the Supreme Court \nsought to distinguish the key words used in Section 10 of the CPC, matter in \nissue is “directly and substantially in issue” in a previously instituted suit, \nfrom the words “incidentally or collaterally in issue”.  In the case before the \nSupreme Court, the respondent sought stay of a suit under Section 10 of the \nCPC on the ground that appellant had filed a Writ Petition against the award \nof the Labour Court and the same was pending before the High Court. The \nSupreme Court held that since the scope of the Writ Petition was entirely \ndistinct and separate from the suit filed before the Civil Court, stay under \nSection 10 of the CPC could not have been granted. Therefore, the reliance \nplaced by the plaintiff on National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro \nSciences (supra)  is misplaced.  \n27. \nThe Supreme Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. (supra) has \ncategorically held that where the marks of the defendant and the plaintiff are \nnot exactly identical, but are similar, the test of infringement would be the \nsame as in an action for passing off i.e., whether there is a likelihood of \nconfusion or deception arising from the similarity of marks.

In \nview thereof reliance placed by the plaintiff on the judgment in Mind Gym \nLtd. (supra) and Pernod Ricard (supra), is misplaced.   \n28. \nReliance has been placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the judgment in \nPukhraj D. Jain (supra) to contend that provisions of Section 10 of the CPC \nare procedural and mere filing of an application under Section 10 of the CPC \ndoes not preclude the Court from examining the merits of the matter. \nHowever, the said judgment does not bar the Court from dealing with an \napplication under Section 10 of the CPC before the final adjudication of the \nsuit.  As noted above, a four Judge Bench of Supreme Court in Manohar \nLal Chopra (supra) has categorically held that provisions of Section 10 of \nthe CPC are mandatory. Therefore, reliance placed on Pukhraj D. Jain \n(supra) is also misplaced. \n29. \nNext, it has been contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the District \nCourt, Ernakulam did not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the \nclaim of passing off and therefore, the bar under Section 10 of the CPC \nwould not apply in view of the language used in Section 10 i.e., “Court in \nIndia having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed”. In this regard, reliance \nhas been placed on a judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench in Bristol-Myers \n(supra). \n30. \nOn the other hand, senior counsel on behalf of the defendants submits \nthat the expression “Court in India having jurisdiction to grant the relief \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 17 of 19 \n \nclaimed” refers to a Court having inherent jurisdiction to entertain the suit \nand not territorial jurisdiction. \n31. \nReliance placed on behalf of the plaintiff on the judgment in Bristol-\nMyers (supra) is misplaced as the findings in the aforesaid judgment were \nmade in the context of a prior suit having been instituted by the defendant \ntherein in a Court which did not have the inherent jurisdiction to entertain \nthe suit. Therefore, in Bristol-Myers (supra) the Court held that the earlier \nsuit was an abuse of the process of law. In the present case, it was the \nplaintiff itself that had filed the earlier suit in District Court, Ernakulam and \nit is nobodies‟ case that the District Court, Ernakulam lacked inherent \njurisdiction to try the suit. \n32. \nIn Channabasappa Kamadal & Sons (supra), the Karnataka High \nCourt expressed the view that the expression “Court in India having \njurisdiction to grant the relief claimed” used in Section 10 of the CPC does \nnot deal with territorial jurisdiction and only refers to the competency of the \nCourt to entertain and grant the relief sought in the suit. I am in respectful \nagreement with the view expressed by the Karnataka High Court in  \nChannabasappa Kamadal & Sons (supra). The expression “Court in India \nhaving jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed” used in Section 10 of the \nCPC cannot be applied in the context of a Court in India not having \nterritorial jurisdiction and would be applicable only when the Court where \nthe earlier suit has been instituted lacks the inherent jurisdiction to try the \nsaid suit.   \n33. \nThere is another aspect to be considered with regard to the aforesaid \nissue.

The interim application \nfiled on behalf of the plaintiff was dismissed by the District Court, \nErnakulam and appeal against the said order was dismissed by the Kerala \nHigh Court and subsequently, the SLP filed before the Supreme Court was \nwithdrawn by the plaintiff. It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed an \napplication under Order XXIII Rule 1 of the CPC seeking to withdraw a part \nof the claim in the said suit relating to passing off with liberty to file the \nsame before a Court with competent jurisdiction. This application was \nallowed by the District Judge, Ernakulam, Kochi by permitting the plaintiff \nto withdraw the part of the claim relating to passing off with liberty to \ninstitute a fresh suit. Pursuant to the said liberty, CS(COMM) 1018/2016 \nwas filed on behalf of the plaintiff. \n34. \nThere is no definite finding given by the District Court, Ernakulam \nwith regard to the District Court, Ernakulam not having territorial \njurisdiction. It was only at the asking of the plaintiff that the plaintiff was \npermitted to withdraw the part of the claim in the said suit with liberty to file \na fresh suit in respect of the subject matter of the part of the claim. The \nplaintiff did not wait for the District Court, Ernakulam to give a finding that \nit lacked territorial jurisdiction and straight away filed an application for \nwithdrawal of part of the claim on the ground of District Court, Ernakulam \nnot having the territorial jurisdiction to try the said suit.  It appears that not \nhaving got an interim injunction in its favour, the plaintiff withdrew the part \nof the claim in the said suit to take a chance before another Court.  \n35. \nThe submission of the plaintiff that the bar under Section 10 of the \nCPC is only in respect of trial of the suit and the expression „trial‟ has to be \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\n2023/DHC/000133 \n \n \nCS(COMM) 1018/2016 & CS(COMM) 814/2018                                                             Page 19 of 19 \n \ngiven a narrow meaning to include only the recording of evidence in the \nsuit, is wholly misplaced.

The CPC's Section 10 requires identical subject matter in both suits to avoid conflicting verdicts.\n2. A similar case was filed in the District Court, and staying this suit would prevent contradictory judgments (Romesh Kumar Bhatia v. Zorrik Enterprises).\n3.

Identiical subject matter in both suits is required under Section 10 of the CPC, and this condition is not met (National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences v. C. Parameshwara).\n3.

SAHNI (supra) are set out below: \n“22. \nEven in Aspi Jal (supra), which is relied upon by the \nlearned senior counsel for the plaintiff, the Supreme Court has \nreiterated that the use of the negative expression in Section 10 \nCPC makes the provision mandatory and the court in which the \nsubsequent suit has been filed is prohibited from proceeding with \nthe trial of that suit.

The objective is also to avoid the possibility of \ncontradictory verdicts by two courts in respect of the same relief \nand is aimed to protect the defendant from multiplicity of \nproceedings.  \n \n23. \nThe fundamental test that is to be applied to determine \nwhether Section 10 was applicable or not, is to see whether on \nthe final decision being reached in the first suit, such decision \nwould operate as res-judicata in the subsequent suit. Where there \nwas “identity of matter” in both the suits i.e., the whole of the \nsubject matter in both the proceedings were identical, even if \nfurther reliefs were claimed in the subsequent suit, it would be \nimmaterial and the second suit would necessarily have to be \nstayed.”  \n \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:09.01.2023 18:24:55\nSignature Not Verified",

In the said case, a suit was filed by the plaintiff \nbefore an Additional District Judge based on the claim of passing off and the \nsaid suit was dismissed. An appeal against the said dismissal was pending \nbefore the High Court. During the pendency of the appeal, a suit for \ninfringement of registered trade mark was filed by the plaintiffs. One of the \nissues framed in the infringement suit was whether the said suit was liable to \nbe stayed. While considering the issue of grant of stay under Section 10 of \nthe CPC, the following observations were made: \n“17. \nThe question that therefore, arises is whether an \nindependent and different finding on the matter of deception \nand conclusion can be given in this suit. This will be \ninescapable as no relief can be granted to the plaintiffs unless it \nis held that the use of the word “Zorrik” by the defendants \nresults in deception and confusion so as to infringe the trade \nmark of the plaintiffs. \n \nXXX \n \n \n \nXXX  \n \n \n \nXXX \n \n22. \nWith this state of law, there is no escape from the \nconclusion that as long as the finding of the Additional District \nJudge in the earlier suit that the sale of ties by the defendants \nunder the mark “Zorrik” does not result in deception and \nconfusion with the consumers in the market so as to identify them \nas those of the plaintiffs stands, no relief whatsoever can be \ngranted to the plaintiffs in the present suit. The proper course \nfor the plaintiffs, therefore, is to pursue their remedy in the \nappeal now pending in the High Court. The subject-matter in \nthe present suit to this extent, therefore, must be held as directly \nand substantially similar to that involved in that appeal.

It is not necessary that the subject matter \nand cause of action in two suits should be identical.

In the case before the \nSupreme Court, the respondent sought stay of a suit under Section 10 of the \nCPC on the ground that appellant had filed a Writ Petition against the award \nof the Labour Court and the same was pending before the High Court. The \nSupreme Court held that since the scope of the Writ Petition was entirely \ndistinct and separate from the suit filed before the Civil Court, stay under \nSection 10 of the CPC could not have been granted. Therefore, the reliance \nplaced by the plaintiff on National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro \nSciences (supra)  is misplaced.  \n27. \nThe Supreme Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd.
