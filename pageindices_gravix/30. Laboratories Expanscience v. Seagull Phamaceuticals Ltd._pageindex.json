    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary:**\n\nThe case of Laboratoires Expanscience vs. Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. involves a dispute over the trademark \"MUSTELA\". The High Court of Delhi heard a petition under Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, seeking rectification of the register of trademarks by removal of the word mark \"MUSTELA\" registered in favour of Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd.\n\n**Background:**\n\nLaboratoires Expanscience is the proprietor of the registered word mark \"MUSTELA\" in Class 3, which stands registered with effect from August 23, 1971. In contrast, Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. had successfully registered the word mark \"MUSTELA\" for medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations in Class 5 vide Registration No. 1607095 on March 31, 2009.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\nThe main issue in this case revolved around whether the registration of the trademark \"MUSTELA\" by Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. should be rectified by removing it from the register due to being identical or similar to the registered mark owned by Laboratoires Expanscience.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\nLaboratoires Expanscience claimed that the registration of \"MUSTELA\" in Class 5 by Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. was a threat to their trademark rights, since they had already registered it for non-medicated lotions and creams for skin care use in Class 3. On the other hand, Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nDuring the hearing of the case:\n\n*   Mr. Manish Singhal, learned Counsel for the respondent (Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd), submitted that his client was willing to give up the word mark \"MUSTELA\" and delete it from the Register of Trademarks.\n*   The court noted this submission and directed Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. to apply for withdrawal of Opposition No. 917190 filed against Laboratoires Expanscience's registered word mark.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on these findings, the High Court of Delhi:\n\n    allowed the petition to rectify the Register of Trademarks by removing Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd.'s Registration No. 1607095 for the word mark \"MUSTELA\" registered in Class 5.\n    directed the Registrar to delete and remove the impugned word mark from the Registry immediately.\n    ordered that the Register of Trademarks shall be rectified accordingly.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nIn essence, Seagull Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd. voluntarily relinquished their trademark rights over \"MUSTELA\", allowing the deletion of its registration and avoiding a full-blown dispute about trademark infringement or similarity of marks.",
