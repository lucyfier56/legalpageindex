Ltd., is engaged in the business of \nmanufacturing and exporting grooming products such as shaving \nrazors, blades, kitchen knives and stationery cutters since 1955. The \npetitioner is Asia's market leader in respect of razors, razor blades, \nkitchen knives and stationery cutters etc. The petitioner is widely \nrecognized around the world for introducing the world‟s first 7-blade \nshaving system. The products of the petitioner are sold in 120 \ncountries around the world.  \n2.2 \nThe petitioner derived the trademark DORCO from the name of its \ncompany, Dorco Co. Ltd., and has used the said trademark in different \nparts of the world since 1964 and in India since 1994. The petitioner \nis the registered proprietor of the trademark DORCO in India in \nvarious classes, since 1994 and obtained the first registration of the \naforesaid trademark on 30th November, 1994 in India. Details of the \nregistration of the trademarks of the petitioner are given on page 3 of \nthe petition.  \n2.3 \nIn 2015, the petitioner partnered with e-commerce platform „Lets \nShave‟ to sell its products in India through www.letsshave.com. Since \nthen, its products are available for sale on several e-commerce \nplatforms in India such as, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, eBay etc. \n2.4 \nThe petitioner has also registered domain name www.dorco.in on 13th \nDecember, 2006, which comprises the petitioner‟s trademark \nDORCO.  \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:14.03.2023 15:05:52\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\n2023/DHC/001821 \n \nC.O.

The petitioner has a strong \npresence on social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram and \nFacebook. \n2.6 \nThe respondent no.1 is the partnership firm of one Mr Govind Prasad \nBagaria and Ms. Rakhi Sureka.  The respondent no.1 got the \ntrademark \nDORCO/ \n \n(hereinafter \n„impugned \ntrademark‟) registered vide registration no.1252224 in respect of \nrazors and razor blades in class 8 in India. The application for \nregistration of the impugned trademark was filed on 28th November, \n2003 claiming use since 1st April, 2001.  \n2.7 \nThe respondent no.1 has not used the registered trademark upto three \nmonths before the date of the present rectification petition, for a \ncontinuous period of five years from the date of registration, in \nrelation to the goods for which the registration was granted. \nTherefore, it is liable to be removed for „non-use‟ in terms of Section \n47(1)(b) of the Act. \n2.8 \nThe registration of the impugned trademark is obtained by the \nrespondent no.1 in collusion with the petitioner‟s distributor in Nepal, \nMr. Pramod Sureka, with the dishonest and malafide intention to ride \non the goodwill of the petitioner. Hence, the same is liable to be \nrectified under Sec 57 (2) of the Act. \n2.9 \nVide email dated 27th July, 2016, Mr. Pramod Sureka informed the \npetitioner that Govind Prasad Bagaria was well aware of the rights \nand reputation of the petitioner and its trademark DORCO and its \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:14.03.2023 15:05:52\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n2023/DHC/001821 \n \nC.O.

However, he demanded Rs. 15,00,000/- to assign the \nimpugned trademark back to the petitioner. \n2.10 The partners of respondent no.1 have also applied for registration of \nthe trademarks of other international brands such as “Anfanna” and \n“Tarzan Boy”. Hence, the partners of respondent no.1 are habitual \ntrademark squatters and serial infringers. \n2.11 Accordingly, the present petition has been filed by the petitioner.  \nProceedings in the suit \n3. \nNotice in the present petition was issued by the Intellectual Property \nAppellate Board (IPAB) on 18th January, 2018. However, the respondent \nno.1 failed to appear before IPAB despite service. Thereafter, the present \nrectification got transferred to this Court after coming into effect of \nTribunals Reforms Act, 2022 and the Court notice was issued to the \nrespondent no.1 by this Court on 25th January, 2022. It is noted in the order \ndated 6th October, 2022 that the respondent no.1 refused to accept notice and \nthat the same amounted to service.  \n4. \nSubsequently, an application for substituted service was filed by the \npetitioner and the same was allowed and the respondent no.1 was directed to \nbe served by way of publication. The affidavit of service has been filed on \nbehalf of the petitioner and the same is taken on record. Therefore, the \nrespondent no.1 is deemed to have been served. None has appeared on \nbehalf of the respondent no.1, nor any reply/counter-statement has been filed \non behalf of the respondent no.1. It is indicative of the fact that the \nrespondent no.1 has nothing substantial to put forth on merits, by way of a \nresponse to the averments made in the petition.  \n \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:14.03.2023 15:05:52\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n2023/DHC/001821 \n \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 50/2022                                              \n \n \n  Page 5 of 7 \n \nAnalysis and Findings \n5. \n I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record of the \ncase.  \n6. \n In order to determine whether the trademark of the respondent no.1 is \nidentical to the trademark of the petitioner, it would be apposite to refer to \nthe two competing trademarks, as set out below:  \nPetitoner‟s Trademarks \nDefendant‟s Trademarks \n \n \n7. \nThe impugned trademark was applied for registration by the \nrespondent no.1 claiming user since 1st April, 2001. However, upto a date of \nthree months before filing the present rectification petition, a period of five \nyears have elapsed from the date of registration of the impugned trademark, \nduring which there has been no bonafide use of the impugned trademark in \nrelation to the goods for which the registration was granted.  \n8. \nIn the judgment in Shell Transource Limited v. Shell International \nPetroleum Company Ltd.¸ 2012 SCC IPAB 29, it was observed by the \nIPAB that the onus of proving “non-user” is on the person who pleads the \nsame. However, when the applicant pleads “non-user”, the respondent must \nspecifically deny it. Therefore, in the absence of a specific denial, it was \nheld that the allegations of “non-user” stood admitted.  \n9. \nIn the present case, the allegations of “non-user” against the \nrespondent no.1 stand admitted in the absence of a specific denial of the \nsame and the impugned trademark is liable to be removed from the Register \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:14.03.2023 15:05:52\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n2023/DHC/001821 \n \nC.O. (COMM.IPD-TM) 50/2022                                              \n \n \n  Page 6 of 7 \n \nof Trade Marks on account of “non-user” as contemplated under Section \n47(1)(b) of the Act.  \n10. \nFrom the facts detailed above, it is clear that the petitioner is the \nproprietor of the impugned trademark. The respondent no.1 cannot claim to \nbe the proprietor of the impugned trademark as there is nothing to show as \nto how the impugned trademark has been adopted by the respondent no.1. \nTherefore, the application for registration of the impugned trademark is in \ncontravention of Section 18(1) of the Act. In fact, the registration of the \npetitioner‟s identical mark in respect of similar goods, was pending in India \nand was also cited as a conflicting mark in the examination report issued in \nthe application for registration of the impugned trade mark. Therefore, as per \nSections 9(1)(a) and 11(1)(a) of the Act, the registration of the impugned \ntrademark could not be granted. \n11. \nThe registration of the impugned trademark is also in contravention of \nSection 11(3)(b) of the Act, as its use would be prevented in India by virtue \nof the law of copyright, as the petitioner is the original owner of copyright in \nthe impugned trademark, which is also registered as a trademark in its \nfavour in Korea since 2002 and thereafter, in Turkey, China and Ukraine. \n12. \nThe grant of registration of the impugned trademark by the respondent \nno.2 is against the principles of Section 11(3)(a) of the Act, as there is no \ndispute that the petitioner is the prior user of the impugned trademark since \n1994 in India and across the world since 1964. Due to such a long, \ncontinuous and extensive use, the impugned trademark is solely associated \nwith the petitioner. Therefore, the registration of the impugned trademark \nshould have been refused by the respondent no.2. \nDigitally Signed By:AMIT\nBANSAL\nSigning Date:14.03.2023 15:05:52\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\n2023/DHC/001821 \n \nC.O.

The nature of the impugned \ntrademark is such that it will deceive the public and create confusion as \nregards the source of the goods manufactured and sold under the impugned \ntrademark.  \n14. \nAccordingly, the present petition is allowed and the impugned \ntrademark registered under trademark application no.1252224 in the name of \nthe respondent no.1 in Class 8 is removed from the Register of Trade Marks.  \n15. \n A copy of the order be sent to the respondents through e-mail.

The respondent no.1 cannot claim to \nbe the proprietor of the impugned trademark as there is nothing to show as \nto how the impugned trademark has been adopted by the respondent no.1. \nTherefore, the application for registration of the impugned trademark is in \ncontravention of Section 18(1) of the Act. In fact, the registration of the \npetitioner‟s identical mark in respect of similar goods, was pending in India \nand was also cited as a conflicting mark in the examination report issued in \nthe application for registration of the impugned trade mark. Therefore, as per \nSections 9(1)(a) and 11(1)(a) of the Act, the registration of the impugned \ntrademark could not be granted. \n11. \nThe registration of the impugned trademark is also in contravention of \nSection 11(3)(b) of the Act, as its use would be prevented in India by virtue \nof the law of copyright, as the petitioner is the original owner of copyright in \nthe impugned trademark, which is also registered as a trademark in its \nfavour in Korea since 2002 and thereafter, in Turkey, China and Ukraine. \n12. \nThe grant of registration of the impugned trademark by the respondent \nno.2 is against the principles of Section 11(3)(a) of the Act, as there is no \ndispute that the petitioner is the prior user of the impugned trademark since \n1994 in India and across the world since 1964.
