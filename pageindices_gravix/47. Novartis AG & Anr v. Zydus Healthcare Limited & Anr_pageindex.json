    "decision_summary": "**Background**\n\nThe case involves a patent infringement dispute between Novartis AG and Zydus Healthcare Limited (ZHL) and its parent company Cadila Healthcare Limited (CHL). Novartis holds a patent for a pharmaceutical composition comprising valsartan and sacubitril, a combination of drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases. ZHL and CHL have applied for trademark registration for the mark \"ARNX\" covering medicinal preparations, including valsartan and sacubitril.\n\n**Facts**\n\nNovartis asserts that the patent has been issued for the unique combination of valsartan and sacubitril, which has a novel and inventive effect. The company claims that ZHL and CHL have applied to register a trademark that covers the same composition, posing a threat to Novartis' commercial interests. Additionally, CHL had filed two patent applications for product and process patents in respect of different forms of valsartan and sacubitril tablets.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nThe main legal issues in this case are:\n\n1. Whether ZHL's trademark registration application infringes on Novartis' existing patent right.\n2. Whether the patent applications filed by CHL are an attempt to create a \"backdoor\" entry into the market, allowing it to circumvent Novartis' patent rights.\n\n**Arguments of the Parties**\n\nNovartis argues that:\n\n1. The trademark registration application made by ZHL is an infringement on their existing patent right.\n2. The application is aimed at deceiving competitors and deceiving consumers.\n\nZHL/CHL argue that:\n\n1. Their trademark registration application does not infringe Novartis' patent rights.\n2. They have a legitimate interest in developing and marketing valsartan and sacubitril for cardiovascular purposes, as they have product and process patents in respect of different forms of the drugs.\n\n**Court Findings**\n\nAfter hearing both parties, the court finds:\n\n1. The trademark application made by ZHL is likely to infringe on Novartis' existing patent right.\n2. CHL's patent applications are an attempt to create a \"backdoor\" entry into the market and circumvent Novartis' patent rights.\n\n**Decision**\n\nIn view of these findings, the court rules in favor of Novartis, issuing a permanent injunction against ZHL/CHL from:\n\n1. Applying for trademark registration for the mark \"ARNX\" covering medicinal preparations, including valsartan and sacubitril.\n2. Infringing on the patents registered by Novartis AG, including IN 229051 and any other relevant patent rights.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe court's decision is based on its findings that:\n\n1. The trademark application made by ZHL/CHL poses a significant risk to Novartis' commercial interests.\n2. CHL's patent applications are intended to create a market entry point through deception, despite the existing patent rights of Novartis.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of careful analysis and investigation before taking actions that could infringe on another company's intellectual property rights.",

The plaint asserts that administration of \nthe combination claimed in the suit patent has greater therapeutic \neffect than the administration of Valsartan or the administration of a \nvasodilator or NEP (Neutral Endopeptidase) inhibitors alone. \nSacubitril is a NEP and Valsartan is a vasodilator. The ―unexpected \nand surprising synergistic antihypertensive effect‖ of the combination \nof Sacubitril and Valsartan is asserted as being novel, non-obvious \nand inventive.   \n \n4. \nIt was in these circumstances, asserts the plaint, that IN 229051 \nwas granted to Novartis, with no sustainable opposition either at pre-\ngrant or post-grant stage.  Post the grant of the suit patent, Torrent \nPharmaceutical Ltd. filed a revocation petition before the learned \nIntellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) which was withdrawn.  \nThe suit patent IN 229051 is, therefore, valid and subsisting. It is due \nto expire on 16th January 2023. \n \n \n5. \nThe suit alleges that Zydus applied to the Registrar of Trade \nMarks for registering the trademark ―ARNX‖ on ―proposed to be \nused‖ basis. The mark ARNX was described as covering ―medicinal, \npharmaceutical and veterinary preparations for medical purpose, for \nmedical use and chemical preparations of Valsartan and Sacubitril for \ncardiovascular purposes‖.  The application was filed by Zydus on 16th \nAugust 2021 and was published in the Trademarks Journal on 13th \nSeptember 2021.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                           Page 3 of 46 \n \n6. \nThe plaint further alleges that Zydus and Cadila are companies \nof the Zydus Cadila Group and that Cadila filed Patent applications IN \n2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 for obtaining product and \nprocess patents in respect of different forms of Valsartan and \nSacubitril tablets and of their manufacturing process.  \n \n7. \nNovartis has also relied upon an investigation stated to have \nbeen conducted by Strategic Analysis India Pvt. Ltd. (SAI), an \nindependent investigation agency.  According to the report dated 14th \nDecember 2021 of the said agency, Cadila had obtained a \nmanufacturing license from the Central Drugs Standard Control \nOrganisation \n(CDSCO), \nAhmedabad, \nfor \nmanufacturing \na \npharmaceutical formulation of Sacubitril and Valsartan, which it \nintended to launch in December 2021.  \n \n8. \nThe application made by Zydus to the Registrar of Trade Marks \nfor registration of the ARNX trade mark, the two patent applications \nIN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 filed by Cadila before the \npatent office and the investigation conducted by SAI, the plaint seeks \nto contend, make out a case of imminent threat to the commercial \ninterests of Novartis by the defendants. \n \n9. \nIn these circumstances, the plaint has been filed as a quia timet \naction, seeking, essentially, a decree of permanent injunction \nrestraining Zydus and Cadila from dealing in any pharmaceutical \ncomposition comprising a combination of Sacubitril and Valsartan or \nany pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as would infringe \nNovartis‘ patent IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625, apart \nfrom rendition of accounts, delivery up, damages and costs.   \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                           Page 4 of 46 \n \n \n10. \nZydus and Cadila have filed their joint written statement by way \nof response to Novartis‘ suit as well as a counter claim, numbered CC \n(Comm) 27/2022. \n \n11. \nAdditionally, Zydus and Cadila have filed the present \napplication under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC, seeking rejection of \nthe plaint instituted by Novartis against them.  \n \n12. \nI have heard, at length, Mr. Chander Lall, learned Senior \nCounsel for Zydus and Cadila and Mr. Hemant Singh, learned \nCounsel for Novartis, on the said application.   \n \nRival Contentions  \n \nSubmissions of Mr Chander Lall, on behalf of the applicant-\ndefendants \n \n13. \nMr. Chander Lall submits that, even while stating that it had \nbeen filed as a quia timet action, the plaint relied on an investigation \nreport by SAI which alleged that Zydus‘ representative, when \ntelephonically contacted by the investigator, stated that Zydus had \nalready commenced manufacture of the Sacubitril and Valsartan \nformulation at Moriya, Ahmedabad.  If the defendants had \ncommenced manufacture, submits Mr. Lall, the plaint could not be \nmaintained as a quia timet action.  Mr. Lall submits that the filing of \nthe plaint as a quia timet action was, therefore, mala fide, to avoid \nmapping the defendants‘ product to Novartis‘. The Commercial \nCourts, 2015 Act read with the High Court of Delhi Rules Governing \nPatent Suits, 2022 (hereinafter ―the Delhi High Court Patent Rules‖), \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                           Page 5 of 46 \n \nhe submits, mandatorily required infringement, in patent cases, to be \ndemonstrated by mapping the suit patent with the allegedly infringing \npatent, which had not been done.  As such, by artful drafting, the \nplaint had created an illusory cause of action.  An illusory cause of \naction, submits Mr. Lall, is as good as no cause of action and renders \nthe plaint liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a).  \n \n14. \nIn order to create an artificial cause of action, submits Mr. Lall, \nthe plaint has resorted to rampant misstatement. For example, he \nsubmits that the allegation in the plaint that the defendant had \nobtained a manufacturing license to manufacture the Sacubitril and \nValsartan combination was false, as no such manufacturing license \nhad been obtained by the defendants. Similarly, insofar as the \napplication, by Zydus, to the Registrar of Trade Marks for having the \nARNX trade mark registered in its favour in respect of the Valsartan-\nSacubitril combination was concerned, Mr. Lall submits that the said \napplication had been made only because the plaintiff and defendants \nwere involved in extensive negotiations to allow the defendant to \nmarket Novartis‘ patented product under the defendant‘s trade mark. \nHad these negotiations fructified, submits Mr Lall, the defendant \nwould have become a licensee of Novartis, and a licensee can never \nbe an infringer.  The details relating to these negotiations, submits Mr. \nLall, have been carefully suppressed in the plaint, while raising a \nbrouhaha about the trademark application filed by Zydus.  \n \n15. \nIn order to maintain a quia timet action, Mr. Lall submits that \nthe onus of proof would be on Novartis to show that Zydus/Cadila had \nan actual intention to launch the allegedly infringing product. A \nmeaningful reading of the plaint, he submits, does not disclose a cause \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                           Page 6 of 46 \n \nof action which is sufficient to maintain a quia timet claim. He relies, \nfor this purpose, on para 28 of the judgment of S. Muralidhar, J. (as he \nthen was, sitting singly) in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries v. Natco \nPharma Limited1, which sets out the requirement of a quia timet \naction and reads as under: \n―29.  \nThe averments in a plaint alleging infringement or \napprehended infringement of a process patent would have to be \nprecise. In Astra Zeneca Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Limited2, the \nCourt referred to the adoption of the device of ‗wordsmithing‘ in \npleadings and the possibility of the Court not entertaining \npleadings that lacked material facts. It was held that ―an action \ncannot be brought on speculation in the hope that sufficient facts \nmay be gleaned on discovery that will support the allegations made \nin \nthe \npleadings.‖ \nIn Connaught \nLaboratories \nLimited v. Smithkline Beecham Pharma Inc.3, the Court in \nOntario held that a statement of claim initiating a quia \ntimet proceedings alleging patent infringement ―must allege a \ndeliberate expressed intention to engage in activity the result of \nwhich would raise a strong possibility of infringement; the activity \nto be engaged in must be alleged to be imminent and the resulting \ndamage to the plaintiff must be alleged to be very substantial if not \nirreparable; and, finally, the facts pleaded must be cogent, precise \nand material. It is not sufficient that they be indefinite or speak \nonly of intention or amount to mere speculation.‖ \n \n16. \nTested on the anvil of Teva Pharmaceutical1, Mr. Lall submits \nthat the plaint is devoid of the requisite pleadings/material particulars \nto show imminent threat to Novartis as a result of launch, by \nZydus/Cadila, of the allegedly infringing product.  \n \n17. \nReferring, \nnext, \nto \nthe \ntwo \npatent \napplications \nIN \n2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625, stated to have been filed by \nCadila for obtaining product and process patents in respect of the \nValsartan-Sacubitril combination, Mr. Lall submits that the \nCommercial Courts Act read with the Delhi High Court Patent Rules \n                                                          \n1(2014) 212 DLT 321 \n2 2009 FC 1209 \n3 (1998) 86 CDR (3d) 36 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                           Page 7 of 46 \n \nrequired Novartis, mandatorily, to file the aforesaid applications, \nwhich were available in the public domain.  Novartis has demurred \nfrom doing so, according to him, only so that they would be saved the \nexercise of mapping the suit patent with the allegedly infringing \npatents which, if done, would reveal that there was no infringement. \nHe has relied, in this context, on Rule 3(A)(ix) and (x)4 as well as \nRule 2(e)5 of the Delhi High Court Patent Rules, which, according to \nhim, mandated mapping, in every case, of the suit patent with the \nalleging infringing patent and did not relax this requirement in the \ncase of quia timet actions. He has also invited attention, in this \ncontext, to paras 9 to 12 of the judgment of the High Court of Patna in \nBhagirath Prasad Singh v. Ram Narayan Rai6: \n―9.  \nOn the other hand the learned counsel appearing for the \nplaintiffs-opposite parties contended that it is well settled that in \nterms of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the \npurpose of rejection of plaint the pleading as made in the plaint can \nonly be looked into. Even written statement is not required to be \ngone into. Since there is no statement in the plaint admitting the \naforesaid facts, the trial Court concerned was within its jurisdiction \nto hold that the subsequent proceeding is not barred by res judicata \nand it requires proper trial after framing of issues. Whatever is \nbrought on record by the defendant would be matter of \nadjudication at the time of deciding the suit finally. The plaintiffs \nmay loose the suit on merit but in the aforesaid circumstances \ncertainly the plaint cannot be rejected in terms of Order VII, Rule \nII of the Code of Civil Procedure. \n \n                                                          \n4 3. \nContent of Pleadings. –  \n \n(A) \nPlaint \n \nThe plaint in an infringement action shall, to the extent possible, include the following \naspects:- \n(ix) Precise claims versus product (or process) chart mapping or in the case of \nSEPs, claim chart mapping through standards; \n(x) Infringement analysis explained with reference to the granted claims in the \nspecification.

No doubt, as per the provisions of Order \nVII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for the purposes of \ndetermining the question of rejection of plaint on the other grounds \nmentioned therein, it is the plaint that has to be looked into, but the \nquestion is that if the plaintiffs have deliberately suppressed the \nmaterial facts, the disclosure of which is required by law to be \nmade in terms of Order VI, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nwhether it was open for the Court concerned to proceed with the \ntrial and decide the suit after framing issues. The order dated 20-\n11-2006 was challenged by the plaintiffs-judgment-debtors \nthemselves before this Court and the civil revision was dismissed \nby a reasoned order dated 1-5-2008. Thus, this fact was well \nknown to the plaintiffs and they were duty bound in law to disclose \nthe same which they have not done. Order VI, Rule 2(1) of the \nCode of Civil Procedure clearly stipulates that the pleadings should \ncontain the material facts. It has been observed by the Apex Court \nin Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner7, that \nomission of a single material fact leads to an incomplete cause of \naction and the statement or plaint becomes bad. Order VII, Rule11 \nof the Code of Civil Procedure lays down an independent remedy \nmade available to the defendant to challenge the maintainability of \nthe suit itself, irrespective of his right to contest the same on \nmerits. The real object of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure is to keep out of Courts irresponsible law suits and in \ncase Court is prima facie persuaded of the view that the suit is an \nabuse of the process of the Court, in the sense that it is a bogus and \nirresponsible litigation, the jurisdiction under Order VII, Rule 11 of \nthe Code of Civil Procedure can be exercised. \n \n11.  \nLaw is well settled that dexterity of the draftsmen whereby \nthe material facts are camouflaged in a cleverly drafted plaint and \nillusionary cause of action is set out, cannot defeat the right of the \ndefendant to get the plaint rejected. In this regard it would be \npertinent to quote the relevant passage of the observation of the \nApex Court in T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal8, as under:  \n \n―We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the \npetitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the Court \nrepeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the \nstatement of the facts found in the judgment of the High \nCourt, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending before \nthe First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant misuse of \nthe mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned \nMunsif Court must remember that if on a meaningful — \nNot formal-reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, \nand meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to \nsue, he should exercise his power and Order 7, Rule 11, \n                                                          \n7 AIR 2004 SC 1801 \n8 AIR 1977 SC 2421 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                           Page 9 of 46 \n \nCPC, taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein \nis fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has created the illusion \nof a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by \nexamining the party searchingly under Order 10 CPC. An \nactivist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits.‖  \n \n12.  \nFrom the aforesaid decisions of the Apex Court rendered in \nT. Arivandandam8 as well I.T.C. Limited v. Debts Recovery \nAppellate Tribunal9 it would emerge that the gross abuse of \nprocess of Court would be condemned. Further, the reading of \nplaint for the purposes of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure would be meaningful reading and not only the formal \nreading of the same. If real cause of action has not been set out in \nthe plaint rather something illusionary has been stated with a view \nto get out the scope of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure, such clever drafting and suppression of material facts \nare not permitted in law and hence such action should be nipped at \nthe bud. Similar view has been taken by learned single Judge of \nthis Court in Vikash Singh v. Sri Krishna Prasad Sinha (C.R. No. \n1044 of 2006) disposed of on 27-9-2007.‖ \n \n18. \nMr. Lall clarifies the position by submitting that patent \napplications IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 filed by Cadila \nwere not in respect of the combination claimed in IN 229051, but \nclaimed distinct improvements over the suit patent.  For maintaining a \nquia timet action, disclosure of the details of the allegedly infringing \npatent/patent application was necessary.  Cadila having, in the said \npatent applications, asserted that the products claimed under the said \npatent applications involved improvements over the combination \nclaimed by Novartis under IN 229051, Mr. Lall submits that, in order \nto maintain a valid quia timet action, Novartis had necessarily to \ncontend that these improvements were illusory, which, in turn, would \nrequire Novartis to undertake the exercise of mapping the claim in the \nsuit patent with the invention claimed under the aforesaid patent \napplications IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625. Mr. Lall has \npressed into service, in this context, Rule 4(A)(iv), (v), (vi) and (vii)10  \n                                                          \n9 AIR 1998 SC 634 \n10 4. \nDocuments to be filed. –  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 10 of 46 \n \nof the Delhi High Court Patent Rules, as well as Order XI of the CPC, \nas amended by the Commercial Courts Act. \n \nSubmissions of Mr Hemant Singh on behalf of the plaintiff \n \n19. \nResponding to the submissions of Mr. Lall, Mr. Hemant Singh \nsubmits, on behalf of Novartis, that a prayer for rejection of a plaint \nunder Order VII Rule 11 could take into account only the averments in \nthe plaint and the documents filed with the plaint, and nothing more.  \nIn order for the defendants to succeed in their application, therefore, \nthey would have to establish, positively, that the averments in the \nplaint of Novartis did not make out a case for infringement.  \n \n20. \nWere the plaintiff to have withheld any material relating to the \ndefendants‘ patent applications, or any other material, Mr. Hemant \nSingh submits that the plaintiff would, perhaps, stand disentitled, on \nthat ground, to any interlocutory relief under Order XXXIX of the \nCPC; that, however, would not constitute a basis to reject the plaint \nunder Order VII Rule 11.  He submits that the plaint was predicated \non facts none of which were alleged to be false.  The truth or \notherwise of the allegations in the plaint, points out Mr. Hemant \nSingh, are to be examined during trial, and not in an application under \nOrder VII Rule 11.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                               \n \n(A) \nDocuments to be filed along with the Plaint \n***** \n \n \n(iv) \nDetails of related patent applications/patents to the suit patent, including \ndivisional applications; patents of addition, if any, in India shall be furnished in a \ntabulated form along with their current status; \n \n(v) \nA summary of the patented invention and infringement alleged shall be annexed \neither as a note or as a PowerPoint presentation printed with two slides per image; \n \n(vi) \nExpert report, if any, relied upon by the Plaintiff for infringement analysis; \n \n(vii) \nCopies of all relevant correspondence;‖ \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 11 of 46 \n \n21. \nMr. Singh points out that, in the plaint, Novartis has \ncategorically alleged that the defendants were proposing to \nmanufacture a drug comprising the Valsartan-Sacubitril combination \nwhich, if manufactured, would infringe the suit patent.  This single \nallegation, he submits, is sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action \non which the plaint could be maintained.  Whether, in fact, the drug \nthat the defendants were proposing to manufacture would, in fact, \ninfringe the suit patent, was a matter of trial.    \n \n22. \nMr. Singh also submits that his client had not instituted the \nplaint against the defendants merely on a fanciful apprehension.  His \nclient had, consequent to obtaining knowledge of the defendants‘ trade \nmark application and patent applications, conducted an independent \ninvestigation.  \n \n23. \nThe correctness of the investigation report, or the data obtained \nthereby, submits Mr. Singh, cannot be determined in an application \nunder Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. \n \n24. \nHaving thus come across the application of Zydus for \nregistration of the trademark ARNX in respect of a combination, the \npatent applications filed by Cadila, again for a Valsartan-Sacubitril \ncombination, and having been informed by the defendants‘ \nrepresentatives that they were in the process of launching of the \nproduct, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that the law could not possibly \nexpect, much less require, the plaintiff to sit back on its heels without \nsetting the legal process in motion against the defendants.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 12 of 46 \n \n25. \nMr. Hemant Singh submits that the allegations made by Mr. \nLall, which also constitute the basis of the application under Order VII \nRule 11 CPC, travel much beyond the plaint and, in fact, constitute the \ndefence of the defendants against the plaint. He has invited my \nattention, in this context, to para 3 of the defendants‘ application \nunder Order VII Rule 11, which reads thus: \n \n―3.  \nIt is respectfully submitted that the present application is \nbeing preferred in view of the patently false statements and \nconcealment in the plaint, which are summarized as under for ease \nof reference, and elaborated in the paragraphs that follow: \n \na.  \nFalse averments regarding manufacture of \nalleged product by the Defendant No 2: It is patently \nfalse and incorrect to allege that Defendant No. 2 has \nobtained a manufacturing licence from CDSCO. It is \nclarified that the Defendants herein have not even applied \nfor such a license, much less obtained the same. No attempt \nto procure such information through a Right to \ninformation(hereinafter referred to as ‗RTI‘) application is \nforthcoming from the plaint. It is submitted that it is usual \npractice to file an RTI application to discern whether a \nDefendant has applied for a manufacturing license, to make \nthe same a cause of action. Filing of RTI applications is a \nmechanism provided by law that, apart from promoting \ntransparency and accountability and empowering citizens, \nprovides concrete proof of Defendant‘s activities and \nassists the Hon‘ble Courts in matters such as the present \nsuit. The Plaintiffs admittedly having various litigation \npending against various companies, are well aware of these \nlegal mechanisms. It is therefore submitted that the absence \nof any attempt to procure credible information on part of \nthe Plaintiffs by a reliable and recognized source is \nconspicuous by its absence, and goes on to show that the \nPlaintiffs are aware that the Defendants have not obtained \nor even applied for such manufacturing license. It is thus \nsubmitted that the contentions and averments in the plaint \nregarding any manufacturing license by the Defendants is \nfalse and the Plaintiffs know them to be false. \n \n \nb.  \nFalse statements in the investigation report and \nincomplete facts: It is submitted that in order to project a \nfalse cause of action, the Plaintiffs have filed an \ninvestigation report that allegedly confirms that the \nDefendant No. 2 has obtained a manufacturing license and \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 13 of 46 \n \nis even manufacturing the infringing product in Moriya, \nAhmadabad. The aforesaid information has been allegedly \nobtained by the investigation agency by interviewing \ncertain employees of the Defendant companies. However, \nremarkably, the investigation report does not even mention \nthe names of the employees interviewed, or the date or time \nof such interviews, or the place in which these interviews \nwere undertaken, and contains no pictures or telephonic \ntranscripts of any such interviews. The investigation reports \nmerely \nprovides \nincriminating \nquotes \nfrom \npersons(unnamed) holding vague designations such as \n‗manager‘, ‗sales manager‘, ‗marketing manager‘ etc. The \nDefendants companies, admittedly having pan India \npresence and operations, have thousands of such regional \nmanagers and marketing personnel. It is thus submitted that \nthe supposed investigation report has woefully failed to \nestablish a cause of action even on a demurer. It is \nsubmitted that such information can by no stretch of \nimagination become a question of trial owing to the \nabsence of any information provided to corroborate the \ncontentions, and thus, merits rejection at this stage itself. \n \nc.  \nContradictory stands in the contentions of the \nPlaintiffs: Apart from the false statements in the \ninvestigation report, it is submitted that the present suit \ncontains averments that are contradictory to the alleged \nfindings of the investigation report filed by the Plaintiffs \nthemselves. On the one hand the Plaintiffs have premised \ntheir suit as a quia timet action, meaning thereby, that there \nis only an apprehension that the Defendants are undertaking \nany of the activities stated in Section 48 of the Patents Act, \n1970 (making, importing, using, offering for sale or selling) \nand on the other hand, the investigation report alleges that \nthe Defendant No 1 is in fact manufacturing the alleged \nproduct in Moriya. Thus, the Plaintiffs have not placed \ncomplete reliance on the investigation report filed by \nthemselves, since, had the Plaintiffs believed their own \ninvestigation report to be true, the present suit ought to \nhave been an infringement suit based on the alleged \nmanufacture of the product by the Defendants as opposed \nto a quia timet action, and Plaintiffs would have \nsubstantiated their claim of infringement with any valid and \nsubstantial proof obtained during the investigation. \nHowever, being fully aware of the fact that no such \nmanufacturing is taking place at Moriya or anywhere else, \nthe Plaintiffs chose to file a quia timet action to reduce their \nburden of proof and filed along with the plaint an \ninvestigation report making bald averments regarding \nmanufacture of the alleged product.

The Defendants herein reserve their \nright to take appropriate legal action against the Plaintiffs \nas well as the investigation agency Strategic Analysis India \nPvt Ltd (SAI) for making the aforesaid false and baseless \nallegations through a fabricated investigation report. \n \nd.  \nConcealments: It is respectfully submitted that the \ntrade mark application mentioned in the plaint have been \nfiled by the Defendant No. 1 since there was an ongoing \nlicensing talks between the parties. The details of licensing \nnegotiations have been conveniently concealed in the \nplaint. It is submitted that a confidentiality agreement and \nterm sheet had been signed between the parties, clearly \nevincing the approval and signatures of the Plaintiffs, \nwhich has been concealed in the plaint. Thus, the \napplications for the trademark ARNX had been filed in \norder to sell the product under the Defendant No 1‘s trade \nmark and nothing more. It is submitted that despite being in \nthe middle of negotiations, no attempt was made by the \nPlaintiffs to seek any clarification as regards this \napplication, or send a letter/legal notice/email to the \nDefendants. The plaint finds no mention of the \nnegotiations, and has been drafted to project that the \nDefendants have indulged in illegal activities allegedly \nunbeknownst to the Plaintiffs. It is submitted that the \naforesaid facts being material particulars have been \nintentionally concealed and merit no indulgence, since had \nthe same been disclosed, it would have become \nimmediately apparent that there is no cause of action in the \npresent suit. \n \ne.  \nFalse averments regarding patent applications of \nDefendant No2: With respect to the patent application, it is \nclarified that patents are a reward for incremental \ninnovation and improvements on the existing art. Thus, the \nDefendant No 2 has filed a patent application seeking a \npatent on the improvement/innovation on the existing art, \nwhich would be put to test before the appropriate forum. \nThus, by no stretch of imagination can it be said that filing \nof a patent application amounts to infringement of an \nexisting granted patent. Itis submitted that the plaint fails to \ndisclose any averments as to what the patent applications \npertain to, apart from a bald averment that the applications \nhave been filed ―pertaining to different forms of Valsartan \nand Sacubitril‖; or where in the patent applications has the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 15 of 46 \n \nDefendant No 1 expressed an interest in manufacturing the \nclaimed product of the Plaintiffs, or what, if any, are the \nsimilarities between the patent applications of the \nDefendant No 1 and the granted claims of the Plaintiffs. It \nis further submitted that the Plaintiffs have not even \nannexed copies of the patent applications with the \ndocuments filed with the plaint, further evincing the vague \npleadings that do not disclose a valid cause of action even \non a demurrer, and in fact, misrepresent the correct factual \nposition. \n \nf.  \nThe present suit is not a valid quia timet action: It \nis submitted that although the plaint avers that the present \nsuit is a quia timet action, none of the factors required to \nprove a valid quia timet action have been fulfilled by the \nPlaintiffs. It is submitted that there cannot be any threat or \napprehension of manufacture or sale of any product \ncontaining valsartan and Sacubirtil by the Defendants since \nthe Defendants were in fact negotiating with the Plaintiffs \nto become the Plaintiffs licensees as mentioned above. \nThere is no reason forthcoming as to why the Defendants \nwould infringe the product that they were in negotiations to \nprocure a license for.‖ \n \n26. \nThe grounds urged in para 3 of the defendants‘ application, \nreproduced supra, submits Mr. Hemant Singh, are not valid grounds \non which Novartis‘ plaint could be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 \nof the CPC. The contentions of Mr. Lall, submits Mr. Hemant Singh, \ncould at best constitute grounds on the basis of which the defendants \ncould urge that the plaint suffered from insufficiency of pleadings.  \n \n27. \nApropos the exception taken by Mr. Lall to the plaintiff not \nhaving mapped the suit patent with the allegedly infringing patents for \nwhich applications IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 had \nbeen filed by Cadila, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that there is no \nprescribed format in which such mapping is required to be done. Apart \nfrom the fact that the very application by Zydus for obtaining the \nARNX trademark was itself sufficient to maintain the plaint, Mr. \nHemant Singh submits that the allegations in para 17 of the plaint \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 16 of 46 \n \nsufficiently mapped the suit patent and the proposed infringing patents \nof Cadila, for Novartis to be able to maintain the suit even on the \naspect of patent infringement.  \n \n28. \nMr. Hemant Singh pressed into service, in respect of his \ncontentions, the judgments of the Supreme Court in Dahiben v. \nArvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali11 and D. Ramachandran v. R.V. \nJanakiraman12.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nWhat constitutes a ―cause of action‖?  The scope of Order VII Rule 11 \n \n29. \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC permits rejection of a plaint in \nsix circumstances, enumerated in clauses (a) to (f).  Of these, the \nclause that the defendants have chosen to invoke is Clause (a), which \nallows the Court to reject the plaint ―where it does not disclose a cause \nof action‖. \n \n30. \nThe peripheries of the expression ―cause of action‖ stand \ndemarcated in several decisions of the Supreme Court.   \n \n31. \nPara 17 of the report in Kunjan Nair Sivaraman Nair v. \nNarayanan Nair13 approves the following definition, contained in \nHalsbury‘s Laws of England: \n― ―Cause of action‖ has been defined as meaning simply a factual \nsituation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from \nthe Court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been \nheld from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be \nproved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a \ndefendant would have a right to traverse. 'Cause of action' has also \n                                                          \n11 (2020)  7 SCC 366 \n12 (1999) 3 SCC 267 \n13 (2004) 3 SCC 277 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 17 of 46 \n \nbeen taken to mean that particular act on the part of the defendant \nwhich gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint, or the subject \nmatter of grievance founding the action, not merely the technical \ncause of action.‖ \n \n32. \nNavinchandra N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra14, approves \nStroud‘s15 definition of ―cause of action‖ as being ―the entire set of \nfacts that gives rise to an enforceable claim … every fact, which if, \ntraversed, the plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment‖. \n \n33. \nIn Gurdit Singh v. Munsha Singh16, the Supreme Court held \nthus, with respect to the expression ―cause of action‖: \n―The expression \"cause of action\" has sometimes been employed \nto convey the restricted idea of facts or circumstances which \nconstitute either the infringement or  the basis of a right and no \nmore. In a wider and more comprehensive sense it has been used \nto denote the whole bundle of material facts  which \na \nplaintiff \nmust prove in order to succeed.‖ \n \n34. \nState of Rajasthan v. Swaika Properties17, A.B.C. Laminart \n(P) Ltd v. A.P. Agencies18, Bloom Dekor Ltd. v Subhash Himatlal \nDesai19, ONGC v. Utpal Kumar Basu20, Hari Shanker Jain v. Sonia \nGandhi21 and Rajasthan High Court Advocates’ Association v. \nUOI22 endorse the following definition of the expression ―cause of \naction‖: \n―The ‗cause of action‘ means every fact which, if traversed, it \nwould be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his \nright to a judgment of the Court.  In other words, it is a bundle of \nfacts which taken with the law applicable to them gives the \nplaintiff a right to relief against the defendant.‖ \n \n                                                          \n14 (2000) 7 SCC 640 \n15 Stroud‘s Judicial Dictionary \n16 AIR 1977 SC 640 \n17 AIR 1985 SC 1289 \n18 AIR 1989 SC 1239 \n19 (1994) 6 SCC 322 \n20 (1994) 4 SCC 711 \n21 (2001) 8 SCC 233 \n22 AIR 2001 SC 416 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 18 of 46 \n \n35. \nThat the bundle of facts which have to be proved by the plaintiff \nin order to succeed in his plaint constitutes ―cause of action‖ for \ninstituting the suit is the view taken by the Supreme Court, \nadditionally, in South East Asia Shipping Company Ltd v. Nav \nBharat Enterprises (P) Ltd.23, Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd v. UOI24, \nU.O.I. v. Adani Exports Ltd.25,  Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. \nLtd. v. M.V. Sea Success I26.  National Textile Corporation Ltd. v. \nHaribox Swalram27 further clarified the position by declaring that \n―each and every fact pleaded by a party in his petition does not ipso \nfacto lead to conclusion that those facts give rise to cause of action \nunless those facts have a nexus or relevance with a lis that is involved \nin the case‖. \n \n36. \nCutting to the chase, the issue of whether a suit discloses, or \ndoes not disclose, a cause of action has to be decided on the basis of \nthe facts averred in the plaint.  If the factual averments in the plaint \nlay out a fair field on which the plaintiffs can be said to have a right to \nsue the defendants, the plaint discloses a cause of action.  The \nlikelihood of success in the suit is altogether immaterial.  If, however, \nthe facts contained in the plaint, seen in conjunction with the \naccompanying documents, do not assert any right in the plaintiffs and \nagainst the defendant, the plaint does not disclose a cause of action \nand is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a) of the CPC.  \nWhat is required, therefore, in the plaint, is only the assertion of a \nright against the defendant, and the existence of supportive assertions \nand material on the basis of which the right is asserted.  What is, \n                                                          \n23 (1996) 3 SCC 443 \n24 (2004) 6 SCC 254 \n25 (2002) 1 SCC 567 \n26 (2004) 9 SCC 512 \n27 (2004) 9 SCC 786 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 19 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 19 of 46 \n \ntherefore, to be seen is whether there exists a basis to assert the right, \nnot whether the basis, or supportive material, is sufficient to sustain \nthe assertion.   \n \n37. \nWhile examining whether the plaint could be rejected Order VII \nRule 11(a), the Court is, therefore, not concerned with the chance of \nsuccess of the plaintiffs, on the basis of the facts averred by him.  That \nis a consideration entirely foreign to Order VII Rule 11(a).  All that \nhas to be seen is whether the plaintiffs have made out a right to sue.  If \na right to sue stands made out on the facts averred in the plaint, the \nplaint discloses a cause of action, even if the cause of action be thin as \ntinsel.   \n \n38. \nIn this backdrop, one may refer to a few authorities which \nauthoritatively exposit the law governing Order VII Rule 11.  Three \nconsiderably recent decisions of the Supreme Court on the point are to \nbe found in Dahiben11, Rajendra Bajoria v. Hemant Kumar Jalan28  \nand Srihari Hanumandas Totala v. Hemant Vithal Kamat29. \n \n39. \nDahiben11, which is often followed, referred to several earlier \ndecisions on the point.  The following passages are relevant:  \n \n―23.4 In Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi30, this Court held that \nthe whole purpose of conferment of powers under this provision is \nto ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and bound to prove \nabortive, should not be permitted to waste judicial time of the \ncourt, in the following words: \n \n―12……The whole purpose of conferment of such power \nis to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and \nbound to prove abortive should not be permitted to occupy \n                                                          \n28 2021 SCC OnLine SC 764 \n29 (2021) 9 SCC 99 \n30 1986 Supp SCC 315 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 20 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 20 of 46 \n \nthe time of the Court, and exercise the mind of the \nrespondent. The sword of Damocles need not be kept \nhanging over his head unnecessarily without point or \npurpose. Even if an ordinary civil litigation, the Court \nreadily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does not \ndisclose any cause of action.‖  \n \n23.5.  The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil \naction is, however, a drastic one, and the conditions enumerated in \nOrder VII Rule 11 are required to be strictly adhered to. \n \n23.6. Under Order VII Rule 11, a duty is cast on the Court to \ndetermine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action by \nscrutinizing the averments in the plaint2, read in conjunction with \nthe documents relied upon, or whether the suit is barred by any \nlaw. \n \n23.7. Order VII Rule 14(1) provides for production of documents, \non which the plaintiff places reliance in his suit, which reads as \nunder: \n \n―14. Production of document on which plaintiff sues or \nrelies.– (1)  Where a plaintiff sues upon a document or \nrelies upon document in his possession or power in \nsupport of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a \nlist, and shall produce it in Court when the plaint is \npresented by him and shall, at the same time deliver the \ndocument and a copy thereof, to be filed with the plaint. \n \n(2) \nWhere any such document is not in the possession \nor power of the plaintiff, he shall, wherever possible, state \nin whose possession or power it is. \n \n(3)  \nA document which ought to be produced in Court \nby the plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be \nentered in the list to be added or annexed to the plaint but \nis not produced or entered accordingly, shall not, without \nthe leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his \nbehalf at the hearing of the suit. \n \n(4) \nNothing in this rule shall apply to document \nproduced for the cross examination of the plaintiff's \nwitnesses, or, handed over to a witness merely to refresh \nhis memory.‖  \n(emphasis supplied)  \n \n23.8 \nHaving regard to Order VII Rule 14 CPC, the documents \nfiled alongwith the plaint, are required to be taken into \nconsideration for deciding the application under Order VII Rule \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 21 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 21 of 46 \n \n11(a). When a document referred to in the plaint, forms the basis of \nthe plaint, it should be treated as a part of the plaint. \n \n23.9 \nIn exercise of power under this provision, the Court would \ndetermine if the assertions made in the plaint are contrary to \nstatutory law, or judicial dicta, for deciding whether a case for \nrejecting the plaint at the threshold is made out. \n \n23.10 At this stage, the pleas taken by the defendant in the written \nstatement and application for rejection of the plaint on the merits, \nwould be irrelevant, and cannot be adverted to, or taken into \nconsideration. \n \n23.11 The test for exercising the power under Order VII Rule 11 \nis that if the averments made in the plaint are taken in entirety, in \nconjunction with the documents relied upon, would the same result \nin a decree being passed. This test was laid down in Liverpool & \nLondon S.P. & I Assn. Ltd. v. M.V.Sea Success I & Anr.26, which \nreads as: \n \n―139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not is \nessentially a question of fact. But whether it does or does \nnot must be found out from reading the plaint itself. For \nthe said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in their \nentirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to \nwhether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to be \ncorrect in their entirety, a decree would be passed.‖  \n \n23.12. In Hardesh Ores (P.) Ltd. v. Hede & Co.31 the Court \nfurther held that it is not permissible to cull out a sentence or a \npassage, and to read it in isolation. It is the substance, and not \nmerely the form, which has to be looked into. The plaint has to be \nconstrued as it stands, without addition or subtraction of words. If \nthe allegations in the plaint prima facie show a cause of action, the \ncourt cannot embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations are \ntrue in fact.  D. Ramachandran12. \n \n23.13. If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the \nsuit is manifestly vexatious and without any merit, and does not \ndisclose a right to sue, the court would be justified in exercising the \npower under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.  \n \n23.14. The power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC may be exercised \nby the Court at any stage of the suit, either before registering the \nplaint, or after issuing summons to the defendant, or before \nconclusion of the trial, as held by this Court in the judgment of \nSaleem Bhai v. State of Maharashtra32.

The provision of Order VII Rule 11 is mandatory in nature. \nIt states that the plaint ―shall‖ be rejected if any of the grounds \nspecified in clauses (a) to (e) are made out. If the Court finds that \nthe plaint does not disclose a cause of action, or that the suit is \nbarred by any law, the Court has no option, but to reject the plaint. \n \n24. \n―Cause of action‖ means every fact which would be \nnecessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support \nhis right to judgment. It consists of a bundle of material facts, \nwhich are necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to entitle him \nto the reliefs claimed in the suit. \n \n24.1 \nIn Swamy Atmanand v. Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam33 \nthis Court held : \n \n―24. A cause of action, thus, means every fact, which if \ntraversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove \nan order to support his right to a judgment of the court. In \nother words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the \nlaw applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to relief \nagainst the defendant. It must include some act done by \nthe defendant since in the absence of such an act, no cause \nof action can possibly accrue. It is not limited to the actual \ninfringement of the right sued on but includes all the \nmaterial facts on which it is founded.‖  \n(emphasis supplied) \n \n24.2. In T. Arivandandam8 this Court held that while considering \nan application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC what is required to be \ndecided is whether the plaint discloses a real cause of action, or \nsomething purely illusory, in the following words : - \n \n―5. …The learned Munsiff must remember that if on a \nmeaningful – not formal – reading of the plaint it is \nmanifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not \ndisclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his \npower under O. VII, R. 11, C.P.C. taking care to see that \nthe ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever \ndrafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it \nin the bud at the first hearing …‖ \n (emphasis supplied)  \n24.3. Subsequently, in I.T.C. Ltd.9, this Court held that law \ncannot permit clever drafting which creates illusions of a cause of \naction. What is required is that a clear right must be made out in \nthe plaint. \n \n                                                          \n33 (2005) 10 SCC 51 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 23 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 23 of 46 \n \n24.4. If, however, by clever drafting of the plaint, it has created \nthe illusion of a cause of action, this Court in Madanuri Sri Rama \nChandra Murthy v. Syed Jalal34 held that it should be nipped in \nthe bud, so that bogus litigation will end at the earliest stage.  The \nCourt must be vigilant against any camouflage or suppression, and \ndetermine whether the litigation is utterly vexatious, and an abuse \nof the process of the court.‖ \n \n40. \nRajendra Bajoria28, which followed Dahiben11, held, with \nrespect to Order VII Rule 11, thus: \n―13. \nNo doubt that, it is rightly contended on behalf of the \nplaintiffs that, only on the basis of the averments made in the \nplaint, it could be ascertained as to whether a cause of action is  \nmade out or not. It is equally true that for finding out the same, the \nentire pleadings in the plaint will have to be read and that too, at \ntheir face value. At this stage, the defence taken by the defendants \ncannot be looked into. \n \n14.  \nWe may gainfully refer to the observations of this Court in \nthe case of T. Arivandandam8: \n \n―5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the \npetitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the court \nrepeatedly and unrepentently resorted to. From the \nstatement of the facts found in the judgment of the High \nCourt, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending before \nthe First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant misuse of \nthe mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned \nMunsif must remember that if on a meaningful — not \nformal — reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, \nand meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to \nsue, he should exercise his power under Order 7, Rule 11 \nCPC taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein \nis fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has created the illusion \nof a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by \nexamining the party searchingly under Order 10, CPC. An \nactivist Judge is the    answer to irresponsible law suits. \nThe trial courts would insist imperatively on examining \nthe party at the first hearing so that bogus litigation can be \nshot down at the earliest stage. The Penal Code is also \nresourceful enough to meet such men, (Cr. XI) and must \nbe triggered against them. In this case, the learned Judge \nto his cost realised what George Bernard Shaw remarked \non the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi: \n―It is dangerous to be too good.‖  \n                                                          \n34 (2017) 13  SCC 174 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 24 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 24 of 46 \n \n[emphasis supplied] \n15. \nIt could thus be seen that this Court has held that reading of \nthe averments made in the plaint should not only be formal but also \nmeaningful. It has been held that if clever drafting has created the \nillusion of a cause of action, and a meaningful reading thereof \nwould show that the pleadings are manifestly vexatious and \nmeritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, then the \ncourt should exercise its power under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. It \nhas been held that such a suit has to be nipped in the bud at the first \nhearing itself. \n \n***** \n17. \nIt could thus be seen that the court has to find out as to \nwhether in the background of the facts, the relief, as claimed in the \nplaint, can be granted to the plaintiff. It has been held that if the \ncourt finds that none of the reliefs sought in the plaint  can be \ngranted to the plaintiff under the law, the question then arises is as \nto whether such a suit is to be allowed to continue and go for trial. \nThis Court answered the said question by holding that such a suit \nshould be thrown out at the threshold.  This Court, therefore, \nupheld the order passed by the trial court of rejecting the suit and \nthat of the appellate court, thereby affirming the decision of the \ntrial court. This Court set aside the order passed by the High Court, \nwherein the High Court had set aside the concurrent orders of the \ntrial court and the appellate court and had restored and remanded \nthe suit for trial to the trial court. \n***** \n19. \nWe are in complete agreement with the findings of the High \nCourt. Insofar as the reliance placed by Shri Jain on the judgment \nof this Court in the case of Dahiben11, to which one of us (L. \nNageswara Rao, J.) was a member, is concerned, in our view, the \nsaid judgment rather than supporting the case of the plaintiffs, \nwould support the case of the defendants.  Paragraphs 23.3, 23.4, \n23.5 and 23.6 in the case of Dahiben11 read thus: \n \n―23.3.  \nThe underlying object of Order 7 Rule 11(a) \nis that if in a suit, no cause of action is disclosed, or the \nsuit is barred by limitation under Rule 11(d), the court \nwould not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the \nproceedings in the suit. In such a case, it would be \nnecessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that \nfurther judicial time is not wasted. \n \n23.4. In Azhar Hussain30 [Followed in Manvendrasinhji \nRanjitsinhji Jadeja v. Vijaykunverba35] this Court held \nthat the whole purpose of conferment of powers under this \nprovision is to ensure that a litigation which is \n                                                          \n35 (1998) 2 GLH 823 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 25 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 25 of 46 \n \nmeaningless, and bound to prove abortive, should not be \npermitted to waste judicial time of the court, in the \nfollowing words : \n \n―12. … The whole purpose of conferment of such \npowers is to ensure that a litigation which is \nmeaningless, and bound to prove abortive should not \nbe permitted to occupy the time of the court, and \nexercise the mind of the respondent. The sword of \nDamocles need not be kept hanging over his head \nunnecessarily without point or purpose. Even in an \nordinary civil litigation, the court readily exercises \nthe power to reject a plaint, if it does not disclose \nany cause of action.‖  \n \n23.5. The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil \naction is, however, a drastic one, and the conditions \nenumerated in Order 7 Rule 11 are required to be strictly \nadhered to. \n \n 23.6. Under Order 7 Rule 11, a duty is cast on the court to \ndetermine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action by \nscrutinising the averments in the plaint [Liverpool & \nLondon S.P. & I Assn. Ltd.26], read in conjunction with \nthe documents relied upon, or whether the suit is barred by \nany law.‖ \n \n20.  \nIt could thus be seen that this Court has held that the power \nconferred on the court to terminate a civil action is a drastic one, \nand the conditions enumerated under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC \nare required to be strictly adhered to. However, under Order VII \nRule 11 of CPC, the duty is cast upon the court to determine \nwhether the plaint discloses a cause of action, by scrutinizing the \naverments in the plaint, read in conjunction with the documents \nrelied upon, or whether the suit is barred by any law. This Court \nhas held that the underlying object of Order VII Rule 11 of CPC is \nthat when a plaint does not disclose a cause of action, the court \nwould not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the \nproceedings. It has been held that in such a case, it will be \nnecessary to put an end to the sham litigation so that further \njudicial time is not wasted.‖ \n \n41. \nSrihari Hanumandas Totala29 dealt essentially with Order VII \nRule 11(d) but also approved the following statement of the law, to be \nfound in Saleem Bhai32, which applies to Clause (a) as well as to (d) \nof Order VII Rule 11: \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 26 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 26 of 46 \n \n―9.  \nA perusal of Order 7 Rule 11 CPC makes it clear that the \nrelevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding an \napplication thereunder are the averments in the plaint. The trial \ncourt can exercise the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC at any \nstage of the suit — before registering the plaint or after issuing \nsummons to the defendant at any time before the conclusion of the \ntrial. For the purposes of deciding an application under clauses (a) \nand (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 CPC, the averments in the plaint are \ngermane; the pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement \nwould be wholly irrelevant at that stage, therefore, a direction to \nfile the written statement without deciding the application under \nOrder 7 Rule 11 CPC cannot but be procedural irregularity \ntouching the exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court. The order, \ntherefore, suffers from non-exercising of the jurisdiction vested in \nthe court as well as procedural irregularity. The High Court, \nhowever, did not advert to these aspects.‖ \n \n \n42. \nEqually, \ninstructive \nare \nthe \nfollowing \npassages \nfrom \nRaghwendra Sharan Singh v. Ram Prasanna Singh36: \n \n―6.7.  In Sopan Sukhdeo Sable7, in paras 11 and 12, this Court has \nobserved as under: \n \n11.  \nIn ITC Ltd.9, it was held that the basic question to be \ndecided while dealing with an application filed under Order 7 Rule \n11 of the Code is whether a real cause of action has been set out in \nthe plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view \nto get out of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code. \n \n12.  \nThe trial court must remember that if on a meaningful and \nnot formal reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious and \nmeritless in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, it should \nexercise the power under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code taking care \nto see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. If clever \ndrafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, it has to be \nnipped in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party \nsearchingly under Order 10 of the Code. (See T. Arivandandam8) \n \n6.8.  \nIn Madanuri Sri Rama Chandra Murthy34, this Court has \nobserved and held as under: \n \n―7.  \nThe plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 if \nconditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled. It is \nneedless to observe that the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC can \nbe exercised by the court at any stage of the suit.

If on an entire and meaningful reading \nof the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and \nmeritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court \nshould exercise power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. Since the \npower conferred on the court to terminate civil action at the \nthreshold is drastic, the conditions enumerated under Order 7 Rule \n11 CPC to the exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be \nstrictly adhered to. The averments of the plaint have to be read as a \nwhole to find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action \nor whether the suit is barred by any law. It is needless to observe \nthat the question as to whether the suit is barred by any law, would \nalways depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The \naverments in the written statement as well as the contentions of the \ndefendant are wholly immaterial while considering the prayer of \nthe defendant for rejection of the plaint. Even when the allegations \nmade in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their face \nvalue, if they show that the suit is barred by any law, or do not \ndisclose cause of action, the application for rejection of plaint can \nbe entertained and the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC can be \nexercised. If clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of \na cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so \nthat bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage.‖ \n \n43. \n In Urvashiben v. Krishnakant Manuprasad Trivedi37, it was \nheld that ―for the purpose of deciding application filed under Order \nVII Rule 11 only averments stated in the plaint alone can be looked \ninto, merits and demerits of the matter and the allegations by the \nparties cannot be gone into‖. There is a litany of similar authorities, \nincluding Kamala v. K. T. Eshwara Sa38 and Vaish Aggarwal \nPanchayat v. Inder Kumar39. \n \n44. \nThe plain words employed by clauses (a) and (d) of Order VII \nRule 11, too, serve to underscore this legal position.  Clause (a) \nrequires the plaint to be rejected ―where it does not disclose a cause of \naction‖. The disclosure or non-disclosure, therefore, has to be in the \nplaint, and the plaint alone. Clause (d), similarly, requires the plaint to \n                                                          \n37 (2019) 13 SCC 372 \n38 (2008) 12 SCC 661 \n39 (2020) 12 SCC 809 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 28 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 28 of 46 \n \nbe rejected ―where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to \nbe barred by any law‖. Again, what is relevant is ―the statement in the \nplaint‖. Whether, therefore, the defendant relies on clause (a) or (d) of \nOrder VII Rule 11, he has to restrict his examination to the averments \nin the plaint, and in the plaint alone – seen, of course, in conjunction \nwith the documents filed with the plaint. \n \n45. \nThat said, the Court has to subject the plaint to careful scrutiny. \nThe entirety of the plaint is to be seen, and a holistic approach \nadopted. Equally, the Court should not allow its discretion to be \nswayed by ―artful drafting‖ of the plaint, aimed at creating a \nsmokescreen of a cause of action, where none actually exists, or \nembellishing a plaint which is actually barred by law by clever \naverments or interpolations which may seem to indicate to the \ncontrary. \n \nApplying the above principles to the facts \n \n46. \nGiven the scope and sweep of Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC as \nthus identified, can it be said that the contentions advanced by Mr. \nLall make out a case for guillotining, at the very inception, the plaint \ninstituted by Novartis, without allowing it the courtesy of proceeding \nto trial? \n \n47. \nIn my considered opinion, they do not. \n \n48. \nThe plaint instituted by Novartis against Zydus and Cadila \nalleges that  \n(i)   \nthe Valsartan-Sacubitril combination forming subject \nmatter of the suit patent has greater therapeutic effect, in \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 29 of 46 \n \ncardiovascular therapy, than administration of Valsartan or NEP \ninhibitors alone, thereby rendering it an improvement over \nexisting state of the art, \n(ii)  \nin conceptualizing and inventing the suit patent, a great \namount of research and experimentation was expended by \nNovartis,  \n(iii)  the suit patent was novel, inventive and not known or \nobvious,  \n(iv)  the suit patent stood granted in over 50 countries,  \n(v)  \nthere was no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit \npatent,  \n(vi)  the Defendants had applied for registration of the mark \n―ARNX‖ in respect of ―medicinal, pharmaceutical and \nveterinary preparations for medical purpose, for medical use \nand chemical preparations of Valsartan and Sacubitril for \ncardiovascular purposes‖, on ―proposed to be used‖ basis,  \n(vii)  the proposed product of the defendant, therefore, if \nmanufactured, would infringe the suit patent IN 229051,  \n(viii)  the SAI investigation report dated 14th December 2021, \nconfirmed that Cadila had obtained manufacturing and \nmarketing approval for a formulation containing Valsartan and \nSacubitril,  \n(ix)  the SAI investigator was informed, by the personnel of \nCadila, that the defendants intended to commercially launch and \nsupply their Valsartan-Sacubitril formulation in the market \nshortly and  \n(x)  \nthus, there was an imminent threat of the defendants \nengaging in activities which would infringe the plaintiffs‘ suit \npatent.     \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 30 of 46 \n \n \n49. \n  These assertions in the plaint are sufficient to constitute a \ncause of action in order to enable Novartis to maintain a quia timet \nsuit.  Mr Lall has relied on the observations in Teva Pharmaceutical \nIndustries1 in this regard.   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries1 holds \nthat (i) a quia timet action ―cannot be brought on speculation in the \nhope that sufficient facts may be gleaned on discovery that will \nsupport the allegations made in the pleadings‖, and (ii) ―the statement \nof claim must allege a deliberate expressed intention to engage in \nactivity the result of which would raise a strong possibility of \ninfringement; the activity to be engaged must be alleged to be \nimminent and the resulting damage to the plaintiff must be alleged to \nbe very substantial if not irreparable; and, finally, the facts pleaded \nmust be cogent, precise and material‖.  The plaint, therefore, is only \nrequired to allege. Proving of the allegations has to be left to trial.  A \nplaint, which so alleges, cannot be thrown out under Order VII Rule \n11 on the ground that the allegations have no merit, or that the \nmaterial placed on record with the plaint is not sufficient to prove the \nallegation.  That said, the decision also cautions that the quia timet \naction must not be merely speculative, merely alleging without the \nfactual basis for the allegation made known.  Equally, the facts \npleaded must be cogent, precise and material.   \n \n50. \nWhat has to be seen, therefore, in assessing whether a quia \ntimet plaint can be rejected outright under Order VII Rule 11, is \n(i) \nwhether the plaint alleges  \n(a) \na deliberate expressed intention to engage in \nactivity the result of which would raise a strong \npossibility of infringement, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 31 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 31 of 46 \n \n(b) \nthat the activity to be engaged in is imminent, and \n(c) \nthat, if the defendant were to engage in the activity, \nthe plaintiff would suffer substantial, if not irreparable, \nprejudice, \n(ii) \nthat the claim of the plaintiff is not merely speculative, in \nthe hope that sufficient facts, to support the allegations, would \nbe gleaned on discovery during the course of trial, and \n(iii) \nthat the plaint contains cogent, precise and material \nrecitals of facts. \nNothing more is to be seen, when examining an Order VII Rule 11 \nchallenge. \n \n51. \nThe plaint, thus seen, satisfies the pre-requisites to maintain a \nquia timet action.  The plaint alleges, with requisite cogency and \nprecision, that Zydus and Cadila are in about to engage in the \nmanufacture of a Valsartan-Sacubitril combination which, if \nmanufactured, would infringe the suit patent.  The plea of substantial \nand, in fact, irreparable prejudice to the plaintiff, were the defendants \nto do so, is inbuilt into the allegation, as the plaintiff claims to be the \nholder of a valid patent for the Valsartan-Sacubitril combination as \ncardiovascular therapy.  The allegation is supported by Zydus‘ \napplication for registration of the ARNX trademark and Cadila‘s IN \n2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 patent applications and the \ninformation collected by SAI during investigation.   The facts pleaded \nare clear and precise, and not merely speculative. \n  \n52. \nThere is also substance in Mr. Hemant Singh‘s submission that, \nas a holder of a valid suit patent claiming the Valsartan and Sacubitril \ncombination as cardiovascular therapy, the plaintiffs could not be \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 32 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 32 of 46 \n \nexpected to sit back when another drug manufacturer applied for \nregistration of a trademark covering an identical combination, applied \nfor a patent in respect of the said combination and also informed the \nplaintiffs‘ investigator that the drug was to be launched in the market \nshortly and that the requisite manufacturing and marketing approval \nhad already been obtained. \n \n53. \nNone of the factors cited by Mr. Chander Lall would, therefore, \njustify emasculation of the plaintiffs‘ suit at the very outset without \ntrial under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. \n \n54. \nMr. Lall also sought to contend that the averments in the plaint \ninstituted by the plaintiffs were prevaricating in nature as, at one \npoint, the suit purported to be a quia timet action whereas, at another, \nit was alleged that the defendants were manufacturing the impugned \nproducts at Moriya, Ahmadabad.  The contention of Mr. Lall is that, if \nthe defendants were, in fact, manufacturing the product at Moriya, \nAhmadabad, the suit could not be maintained as a quia timet action. \n \n55. \nEven if this contention were to be accepted, it would not make \nout a case for rejection of the plaint filed by Novartis under Order VII \nRule 11.  Contradictions in a plaint, even if they exist, cannot be a \nground to reject the plaint at the outset without trial.   That apart, it is \ndoubtful whether this contention is even available to Mr. Lall, as the \ndefendants, in their Order VII Rule 11 application, specifically \ncontend that they are not manufacturing the Valsartan and Sacubitril \ncombination and have not obtained any manufacturing or marketing \nlicense thereof.

The \nplaintiffs having specifically alleged that Cadila had applied for \nregistration of its patents IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625, \nMr. Lall contends that the plaint instituted by the plaintiffs was \ndefective as it did not disclose the details of the suit patent \napplications, which were available in the public domain, or map the \nsuit patent on to the patents forming subject matter of the said \napplications.  \n \n57. \nEven if this were so, it would not justify any conclusion that the \nplaint of Novartis was devoid of a cause of action so as to justify its \nrejection under Order VII Rule 11(a).   \n \n58. \nAll that Rule 3(A)(ix) and (x)4 of the Delhi High Court Patent \nRules require is that a plaint in a patent infringement action shall, to \nthe extent possible, include ―precise claims versus product (or process) \nchart mapping‖ and ―infringement analysis explained with respect to \nthe granted claims in this specification‖.  The applicability of these \nprovisions, in the case of a quia timet action where the patent of the \ndefendant has yet to be granted, is itself questionable.

The various contents which a plaint \nin a patent suit is required to contain, as envisaged by Rule 3(A) \nthereof are merely in the nature of guidelines, intended at facilitating \nan expeditious resolution of the dispute.  Even if the plaint in a patent \ninfringement suit does not, stricto sensu, contain all the details \nenvisaged in the various clauses of Rule 3(A), in the manner as \ncontemplated therein, the plaint would not be liable to be rejected on \nthat score.   \n \n59. \nThe fact that the various clauses in the Rule 3(A) of the Delhi \nHigh Court Patent Rules are not cast in iron is apparent even from the \nuse of the word ―to the extent possible‖. \n \n60. \nThere are number of decisions which hold unequivocally, that a \nconsiderable degree of flexibility is imputed by the use of the words \n―as far as possible‖.  \n \n61. \nIn K. K. Sharma v. UOI40, it was held that the expression ―as \nfar as possible‖ provides for desired flexibility which could be said to \nbe akin to a play in the joints of administrative machinery. The \nexpression was said, in Osmania University v. V.S. Muthurangam41, \nto ―inhere in it and in-built flexibility‖. In Rajendra Singh v. State of \nU.P.42, the Supreme Court held that the expression ―as far as possible‖ \nwould mean a discretion vested in the prescribed authority which it \ncan exercise at the time of carving the surplus area from out of the \ntotal holding of a person‖. \n \n                                                          \n40 1982 (2) SLJ 635 \n41 1997 10 SCC 741 \n42 1998 7 SCC 654 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 35 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 35 of 46 \n \n62. \nIridium India Telecom Ltd v.

Pratabmull Rameswar44 in the \nfollowing words: \n―44.  \nThe Full Bench of the High Court of Calcutta \nin Manickchand Durgaprasad44 had occasion to consider this very \ncontention with regard to clause 37 of the Letters Patent and \nobserved:  \n \n―The restriction upon the power of the Court as contained \nin the proviso to clause 37 of the Letters Patent is that the \nrules framed under that clause should, ‗as far as possible‘ \nbe in conformity with the provisions of the Code of Civil \nProcedure. This restriction as the phrase ‗as far as possible‘ \nindicates is merely directory. The provisions of the Code of \nCivil Procedure are intended for the purpose of guidance of \nthis Court in framing rules under clause 37 of the Letters \nPatent. Consequently, if any rule framed by the High Court \nunder clause 37 be inconsistent with or confers any \nadditional power besides what is granted by the Code of \n                                                          \n43 (2005) 2 SCC 145 \n44 AIR 1961 Cal 483 (FB) \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 36 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 36 of 46 \n \nCivil Procedure, the rule framed under clause 37 will \nprevail over the corresponding provisions of the Code of \nCivil Procedure.‖ \n \nThis we think is the correct view to be taken in interpreting the \nwords ―as far as possible‖ in clause 37 of the Letters Patent. This \ninterpretation would be consistent with the amplitude of the words \nused in Section 129 CPC by which the High Court is empowered to \nmake rules ―not inconsistent with the Letters Patent to regulate its \nown procedure in the exercise of its original jurisdiction as it shall \nthink fit‖. \n \n63. \nIn 38 of the report in state of State of Madhya Pradesh v. \nNarmada Bachao Andolan45, the legal position with respect to \ninterpretation of the expression ―as far as possible‖ was clarified still \nfurther, thus: \n― “As far as possible” \n \n38.  \nThe aforesaid phrase provides for flexibility, clothing the \nauthority concerned with powers to meet special situations where \nthe normal process of resolution cannot flow smoothly. The \naforesaid phrase can be interpreted as not being prohibitory in \nnature. The said words rather connote a discretion vested in the \nprescribed authority. It is thus discretion and not compulsion. There \nis no hard-and-fast rule in this regard as these words give a \ndiscretion to the authority concerned. Once the authority exercises \nits discretion, the court should not interfere with the said \ndiscretion/decision unless it is found to be palpably arbitrary. \n(Vide Iridium India Telecom Ltd.43 and High Court of Judicature \nfor Rajasthan v. Veena Verma46 ) Thus, it is evident that this \nphrase simply means that the principles are to be observed unless it \nis not possible to follow the same in the particular circumstances of \na case.‖ \n \n64. \nEtymologically, the expressions ―to the extent possible‖ and ―as \nfar as possible‖ are synonymous. The aforesaid decisions which lay \ndown the principles for interpretation of the expression ―as far as \npossible‖ would, therefore, apply equally to interpretation of the \nexpression ―to the extent possible‖. \n                                                          \n45 (2011) 7 SCC 639 \n46(2009) 14 SCC 734  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 37 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 37 of 46 \n \n \n65. \nThe use of the expression ―to the extent possible‖ in Rule 3(A) \nof the Delhi High Court Patent Rules, therefore, indicates that strict \ncompliance with the rigour of the various clauses of the said rule is \nnot mandatory and that a plaintiff is expected to comply therewith \nonly to the extent it is possible to do so. This reasoning would apply, \nmutatis mutandis, to Rule 4(A) of the Delhi High Court Patent Rules10 \nas well, which, too, requires the documents enumerated in the Rule to \nbe filed with the plaint ―to the extent possible‖. \n \n66. \nPatent legislation is, in a manner of speaking, sui generis and \nthe compulsions and considerations that guide such legislation are \noften unique.  The use of the expression ―to the extent possible‖ is, \ntherefore, cautious, circumspect and well-guided, and, if the Court \nwere to hold the provisions of Rule 3(A) and 4(A) to be mandatory, \nand a plaint that does not conform to the protocol envisaged by the \nsaid provisions to be vulnerable to rejection under Order VII Rule 11, \nthe Court may well be militating against the intent of the Rule makers \nin incorporating the ―to the extent possible‖ caveat.  There may be any \nnumber of reasons why it is not possible to adhere to the disclosure \nregime envisaged by Rule 3(A) of the Delhi High Court Patent Rules, \nincluding, inter alia, considerations of confidentiality and practical \nimpossibility.  It cannot be said that the mere accessibility, or \navailability, of the details envisaged by Rules 3(A) or 4(A) would, in \nevery case, make it possible to place the said details on record.  The \nRule makers have, therefore, consciously required compliance with \nthe protocol prescribed in Rule 3(A) only to the extent possible.  The \ncorollary would, therefore, be that non-compliance with the protocol \nwould not invalidate the plaint.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 38 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 38 of 46 \n \n \n67. \nEven otherwise, it is well-settled that rules of procedure are to \nbe treated as directory, even if they use the expression ―shall‖. Where \nprescriptive stipulations do not also prescribe the sanction which \nwould follow on their violation, the prescription is to be regarded, \nordinarily, as directory, rather than mandatory.  The position in law, in \nthis regard, is elucidated, without any equivocation whatsoever, in the \nfollowing passages from Rani Kusum v. Kanchan Devi47: \n―9.  \nOrder 8 Rule 1 after the amendment casts an obligation on \nthe defendant to file the written statement within 30 days from the \ndate of service of summons on him and within the extended time \nfalling within 90 days. The provision does not deal with the power \nof the court and also does not specifically take away the power of \nthe court to take the written statement on record though filed \nbeyond the time as provided for. Further, the nature of the \nprovision contained in Order 8 Rule 1 is procedural. It is not a part \nof the substantive law. The substituted Order 8 Rule 1 intends to \ncurb the mischief of unscrupulous defendants adopting dilatory \ntactics, delaying the disposal of cases causing inconvenience to \nplaintiffs and petitioners approaching the court for quick relief and \nalso to the serious inconvenience of the court faced with frequent \nprayers for adjournments. The object is to expedite the hearing and \nnot to scuttle the same. While justice delayed may amount to justice \ndenied, justice hurried may in some cases amount to justice buried. \n \n10.  \nAll the rules of procedure are the handmaid of justice. The \nlanguage employed by the draftsman of processual law may be \nliberal or stringent, but the fact remains that the object of \nprescribing procedure is to advance the cause of justice. In an \nadversarial system, no party should ordinarily be denied the \nopportunity of participating in the process of justice dispensation. \nUnless compelled by express and specific language of the statute, \nthe provisions of CPC or any other procedural enactment ought \nnot to be construed in a manner which would leave the court \nhelpless to meet extraordinary situations in the ends of justice. \n \n11.  \nThe mortality of justice at the hands of law troubles a \njudge's conscience and points an angry interrogation at the law \nreformer. \n \n12.  \nThe processual law so dominates in certain systems as to \noverpower substantive rights and substantial justice. The humanist \nrule that procedure should be the handmaid, not the mistress, of \n                                                          \n47 (2005) 6 SCC 705 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 39 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 39 of 46 \n \nlegal justice compels consideration of vesting a residuary power in \nthe judges to act ex debito justitiae where the tragic sequel \notherwise would be wholly inequitable. Justice is the goal of \njurisprudence, processual, as much as substantive. (See Sushil \nKumar Sen v. State of Bihar48 ) \n \n13.  \nNo person has a vested right in any course of procedure. He \nhas only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner for the \ntime being by or for the court in which the case is pending, and if, \nby an Act of Parliament the mode of procedure is altered, he has no \nother right than to proceed according to the altered mode. \n(See Blyth v. Blyth49 ) A procedural law should not ordinarily be \nconstrued as mandatory; the procedural law is always subservient \nto and is in aid to justice. Any interpretation which eludes or \nfrustrates the recipient of justice is not to be followed. \n(See Shreenath v. Rajesh50 ) \n \n14.  \nProcessual law is not to be a tyrant but a servant, not an \nobstruction but an aid to justice. Procedural prescriptions are the \nhandmaid and not the mistress, a lubricant, not a resistant in the \nadministration of justice. \n \n15.  \nIt is also to be noted that though the power of the court \nunder the proviso appended to Rule 1 Order 8 is circumscribed by \nthe words “shall not be later than ninety days” but the \nconsequences flowing from non-extension of time are not \nspecifically provided for though they may be read in by necessary \nimplication. Merely because a provision of law is couched in a \nnegative language implying mandatory character, the same is not \nwithout exceptions. The courts, when called upon to interpret the \nnature of the provision, may, keeping in view the entire context in \nwhich the provision came to be enacted, hold the same to be \ndirectory though worded in the negative form. \n \n16.  \nChallenge to the constitutional validity of the Amendment \nAct and the 1999 Amendment Act was rejected by this Court \nin Salem Advocate Bar Assn. v. Union of India (I)51  . However, \nto work out modalities in respect of certain provisions a Committee \nwas constituted. After receipt of the Committee's report the matter \nwas considered by a three-Judge Bench in Salem Advocate Bar \nAssn. v. Union of India (II)52 . As regards Order 8 Rule 1 the \nCommittee's report is as follows : (SCC pp. 362-64, paras 15-21) \n \n―15.  \nThe question is whether the court has any power or \njurisdiction to extend the period beyond 90 days. The \nmaximum period of 90 days to file written statement has \n                                                          \n48(1975) 1 SCC 774 \n49 (1966) 1 All ER 524 \n50 (1998) 4 SCC 543  \n51 (2003) 1 SCC 49 : JT (2002) 9 SC 175 \n52 (2005) 6 SCC 344 : JT (2005) 6 SC 486 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 40 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 40 of 46 \n \nbeen provided but the consequences on failure to file \nwritten statement within the said period have not been \nprovided for in Order 8 Rule 1. The point for consideration \nis whether the provision providing for maximum period of \nninety days is mandatory and, therefore, the court is \naltogether powerless to extend the time even in an \nexceptionally hard case. \n \n16.  \nIt has been common practice for the parties to take \nlong adjournments for filing written statements. The \nlegislature with a view to curb this practice and to avoid \nunnecessary delay and adjournments, has provided for the \nmaximum period within which the written statement is \nrequired to be filed. The mandatory or directory nature of \nOrder 8 Rule 1 shall have to be determined by having \nregard to the object sought to be achieved by the \namendment. It is, thus, necessary to find out the intention of \nthe legislature. The consequences which may follow and \nwhether the same were intended by the legislature have \nalso to be kept in view. \n \n17.  \nIn Raza Buland Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Municipal \nBoard, Rampur53, a Constitution Bench of this Court held \nthat the question whether a particular provision is \nmandatory or directory cannot be resolved by laying down \nany general rule and it would depend upon the facts of each \ncase and for that purpose the object of the statute in making \nout the provision is the determining factor. The purpose for \nwhich the provision has been made and its nature, the \nintention of the legislature in making the provision, the \nserious general inconvenience or injustice to persons \nresulting from whether the provision is read one way or the \nother, the relation of the particular provision to other \nprovisions dealing with the same subject and other \nconsiderations which may arise on the facts of a particular \ncase including the language of the provision, have all to be \ntaken into account in arriving at the conclusion whether a \nparticular provision is mandatory or directory. \n \n18.  \nIn Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal, Kotah54 , \nconsidering the provisions of the Code dealing with the trial \nof the suits, it was opined that : (SCR pp. 8-9) \n \n‗ \nNow a code of procedure must be regarded \nas such.

But \ntaken by and large, and subject to that proviso, our \nlaws of procedure should be construed, wherever \nthat is reasonably possible, in the light of that \nprinciple.‘ \n \n19.  \nIn Topline \nShoes \nLtd. v. Corpn. \nBank55 the \nquestion for consideration was whether the State Consumer \nDisputes Redressal Commission could grant time to the \nrespondent to file reply beyond total period of 45 days in \nview of Section 13(2) of the Consumer Protection Act, \n1986. It was held that the intention to provide a time-frame \nto file reply is really made to expedite the hearing of such \nmatters and avoid unnecessary adjournments. It was \nnoticed that no penal consequences had been prescribed if \nthe reply is not filed in the prescribed time. The provision \nwas held to be directory. It was observed that the provision \nis more by way of procedure to achieve the object of speedy \ndisposal of the case. \n \n20.  \nThe use of the word „shall‟ in Order 8 Rule 1 by \nitself is not conclusive to determine whether the provision is \nmandatory or directory. We have to ascertain the object \nwhich is required to be served by this provision and its \ndesign and context in which it is enacted. The use of the \nword „shall‟ is ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of \nthe provision but having regard to the context in which it is \nused or having regard to the intention of the legislation, the \nsame can be construed as directory.

The rules of procedure are the handmaid of \njustice and not its mistress. In the present context, the strict \ninterpretation would defeat justice. \n \n21.  \nIn construing this provision, support can also be \nhad from Order 8 Rule 10 which provides that where any \nparty from whom a written statement is required under \nRule 1 or Rule 9, fails to present the same within the time \npermitted or fixed by the court, the court shall pronounce \njudgment against him, or make such other order in relation \nto the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement \nunder this provision, the court has been given the discretion \neither to pronounce judgment against the defendant or \nmake such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. \nIn the context of the provision, despite use of the word \n„shall‟, the court has been given the discretion to \npronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the \ndefendant even if written statement is not filed and instead \npass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In \nconstruing the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 and Rule 10, the \ndoctrine of harmonious construction is required to be \napplied. The effect would be that under Rule 10 of Order 8, \nthe court in its discretion would have the power to allow \nthe defendant to file written statement even after expiry of \nthe period of 90 days provided in Order 8 Rule 1. There is \nno restriction in Order 8 Rule 10 that after expiry of ninety \ndays, further time cannot be granted. The court has wide \npower to „make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks \nfit‟. Clearly, therefore, the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 \nproviding for the upper limit of 90 days to file written \nstatement is directory. Having said so, we wish to make it \nclear that the order extending time to file written statement \ncannot be made in routine. The time can be extended only \nin exceptionally hard cases. While extending time, it has to \nbe borne in mind that the legislature has fixed the upper \ntime-limit of 90 days. The discretion of the court to extend \nthe time shall not be so frequently and routinely exercised \nso as to nullify the period fixed by Order 8 Rule 1.‖ \n(emphasis in original) \n \n17.  \nThe Bench in JT para 54 after considering the Committee's \nReport has observed as follows : (SCC p. 374, para 50) \n \n―50.  \nHaving regard to the constitutional obligation to \nprovide fair, quick and speedy justice, we direct the Central \nGovernment to examine the aforesaid suggestions and \nsubmit a report to this Court within four months.‖ \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 43 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 43 of 46 \n \n18.  \nAfter elaborating the purpose for introduction of Order 8 \nRule 1, this Court in Kailash56 at SCC para 45 observed that no \nstraitjacket formula can be laid down except that observance of \ntime schedule contemplated by Order 8 Rule 1 shall be the rule and \ndeparture therefrom an exception, made for satisfactory reasons \nonly. The conclusions have been summed up in SCC para 46. The \nrelevant portion reads as follows : (SCC pp. 500-01) \n \n―46. (iv) The purpose of providing the time schedule for \nfiling the written statement under Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is to \nexpedite and not to scuttle the hearing. The provision spells \nout a disability on the defendant. It does not impose an \nembargo on the power of the court to extend the time. \nThough the language of the proviso to Rule 1 Order 8 CPC \nis couched in negative form, it does not specify any penal \nconsequences flowing from the non-compliance. The \nprovision being in the domain of the procedural law, it has \nto be held directory and not mandatory. The power of the \ncourt to extend time for filing the written statement beyond \nthe time schedule provided by Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is not \ncompletely taken away. \n \n(v)  \nThough Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is a part of procedural \nlaw and hence directory, keeping in view the need for \nexpeditious trial of civil causes which persuaded Parliament \nto enact the provision in its present form, it is held that \nordinarily the time schedule contained in the provision is to \nbe followed as a rule and departure therefrom would be by \nway of exception. A prayer for extension of time made by \nthe defendant shall not be granted just as a matter of routine \nand merely for the asking, more so when the period of 90 \ndays has expired. Extension of time may be allowed by way \nof an exception, for reasons to be assigned by the defendant \nand also be placed on record in writing, howsoever briefly, \nby the court on its being satisfied. Extension of time may be \nallowed if it is needed to be given for circumstances which \nare exceptional, occasioned by reasons beyond the control \nof the defendant and grave injustice would be occasioned if \nthe time was not extended. Costs may be imposed and \naffidavit or documents in support of the grounds pleaded by \nthe defendant for extension of time may be demanded, \ndepending on the facts and circumstances of a given case.‖ \n \n68. \nNon-compliance with the protocol prescribed in Rule 3(A) of \nthe Delhi High Court Patent Rules cannot, therefore, be cited as a \nground to reject a plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. \n                                                          \n56 (2005) 4 SCC 480 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 44 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 44 of 46 \n \n \n69. \nMr. Lall also sought to contend that, in examining whether a \nplaint was supported by the requisite cause of action, the Court was \nnot to allow itslf to be misled by artful drafting, which sought to point \nat the existence of cause of action where non actually existed. He \nsubmits that the present case was an instance of such ―artful drafting‖ \nwhereby Novartis was setting up a cause of action where there was, in \nreality, none. He juxtaposes this submission with his submission that \nthe plaintiff had not placed on record the details of the patent \napplications IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 filed by \nCadila. Had he done so, Mr. Lall submits that Novartis would \nadditionally have to map the suit patent to the said patents, which \nwould expose the plaint as being bereft of any cause of action. \n \n70. \nThe argument, in my view, is stretching the limits of Order VII \nRule 11(a) of the CPC to an unacceptable degree. The existence, or \nnon-existence, of a cause of action to base a plaint, for the purposes of \nOrder VII Rule 11(a) has, it may be reiterated, to be determined solely \non the basis of the allegations in the plaint. If the assertions and \nallegations in the plaint, even if proved and established by the \nplaintiff, do not make out a case for grant, to the plaintiff, of the relief \nsought in the plaint, it may be said that the plaint is bereft of a cause \nof action and merits rejection under Order VII Rule 11(a). The present \ncase does not, however, make out any such case for rejection. The suit \npatent asserted in the plaint is specifically for a combination of \nValsartan and Sacubitril. The patent applications IN 2655MUM2015 \nand IN 201621044625 filed by Cadila were also for a combination for \nValsartan and Sacubitril. That, by itself, was sufficient to justify the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 45 ---\n Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462 \nCS(COMM) 681/2021                                                                                                                                          Page 45 of 46 \n \ninvocation, by the Novartis of remedies available against Zydus and \nCadila in civil law. \n \n71. \nMr. Lall also sought to contend that, by not disclosing the fact \nthat the defendants were negotiating with Novartis to manufacture and \nmarket the Valsartan-Sacubitril combination under their brand name \nARNX, the plaintiff had created an artificial cause of action. Had the \ndetails of the said negotiations been disclosed, the circumstances in \nwhich Zydus had applied for registration of the ARNX trademark \nwould have become apparent. \n \n72. \nThat, again, cannot be a basis to contend that the plaintiff has \nnot made out a cause of action in the plaint. It is precisely to deal with \nsuch an argument that Courts have held, time and again, that an \napplication under Order VII Rule 11(a) or (d) has to be decided on the \nbasis of the assertions and allegations in the plaint alone, without \nreferring to the defence of the defendant. What Mr. Lall is calling \nupon this Court to do, by this submission, is to hold, on the basis of \nthe defence that Zydus intends to put up to the submission of the \nplaintiff that Zydus has applied for registration of the ARNX mark,  \nthat Novartis had no cause of action against Zydus. Doing so would \nmilitate against the most fundamental principles of Order VII Rule 11. \nThe contention of Zydus that it had applied for registration of ARNX \nmark as a pursuant to negotiations with Novartis is, at best, a defence \nto the submission of Novartis in that regard. It forms no part of the \nplaint in the present case; ergo, it cannot form any part of the \nconsideration by the Court while examining the application of the \ndefendants under Order VII Rule 11.

The plaint asserts that administration of \nthe combination claimed in the suit patent has greater therapeutic \neffect than the administration of Valsartan or the administration of a \nvasodilator or NEP (Neutral Endopeptidase) inhibitors alone. \nSacubitril is a NEP and Valsartan is a vasodilator.

Post the grant of the suit patent, Torrent \nPharmaceutical Ltd. filed a revocation petition before the learned \nIntellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) which was withdrawn.  \nThe suit patent IN 229051 is, therefore, valid and subsisting.

The mark ARNX was described as covering ―medicinal, \npharmaceutical and veterinary preparations for medical purpose, for \nmedical use and chemical preparations of Valsartan and Sacubitril for \ncardiovascular purposes‖.

He claims that the plaintiff has resorted to misstatements and artful drafting to create an illusory cause of action.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Lall points out:\n\n* The allegation in the plaint that the defendant obtained a manufacturing license for Sacubitril and Valsartan is false.\n* The defendant's application to register a trade mark was made due to negotiations between the parties, which would have made the defendant a licensee of Novartis, thus not an infringer.\n\nMr. Lall argues that these misstatements render the plaint liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a) for having no cause of action.\n\n**PDF Source:** Novartis AG & Anr v.

As such, by artful drafting, the \nplaint had created an illusory cause of action.  An illusory cause of \naction, submits Mr. Lall, is as good as no cause of action and renders \nthe plaint liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a).  \n \n14. \nIn order to create an artificial cause of action, submits Mr. Lall, \nthe plaint has resorted to rampant misstatement. For example, he \nsubmits that the allegation in the plaint that the defendant had \nobtained a manufacturing license to manufacture the Sacubitril and \nValsartan combination was false, as no such manufacturing license \nhad been obtained by the defendants. Similarly, insofar as the \napplication, by Zydus, to the Registrar of Trade Marks for having the \nARNX trade mark registered in its favour in respect of the Valsartan-\nSacubitril combination was concerned, Mr. Lall submits that the said \napplication had been made only because the plaintiff and defendants \nwere involved in extensive negotiations to allow the defendant to \nmarket Novartis‘ patented product under the defendant‘s trade mark. \nHad these negotiations fructified, submits Mr Lall, the defendant \nwould have become a licensee of Novartis, and a licensee can never \nbe an infringer.  The details relating to these negotiations, submits Mr. \nLall, have been carefully suppressed in the plaint, while raising a \nbrouhaha about the trademark application filed by Zydus.  \n \n15. \nIn order to maintain a quia timet action, Mr. Lall submits that \nthe onus of proof would be on Novartis to show that Zydus/Cadila had \nan actual intention to launch the allegedly infringing product.

He relies, \nfor this purpose, on para 28 of the judgment of S. Muralidhar, J. (as he \nthen was, sitting singly) in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries v. Natco \nPharma Limited1, which sets out the requirement of a quia timet \naction and reads as under: \n―29.  \nThe averments in a plaint alleging infringement or \napprehended infringement of a process patent would have to be \nprecise. In Astra Zeneca Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Limited2, the \nCourt referred to the adoption of the device of ‗wordsmithing‘ in \npleadings and the possibility of the Court not entertaining \npleadings that lacked material facts. It was held that ―an action \ncannot be brought on speculation in the hope that sufficient facts \nmay be gleaned on discovery that will support the allegations made \nin \nthe \npleadings.‖ \nIn Connaught \nLaboratories \nLimited v. Smithkline Beecham Pharma Inc.3, the Court in \nOntario held that a statement of claim initiating a quia \ntimet proceedings alleging patent infringement ―must allege a \ndeliberate expressed intention to engage in activity the result of \nwhich would raise a strong possibility of infringement; the activity \nto be engaged in must be alleged to be imminent and the resulting \ndamage to the plaintiff must be alleged to be very substantial if not \nirreparable; and, finally, the facts pleaded must be cogent, precise \nand material. It is not sufficient that they be indefinite or speak \nonly of intention or amount to mere speculation.‖ \n \n16. \nTested on the anvil of Teva Pharmaceutical1, Mr. Lall submits \nthat the plaint is devoid of the requisite pleadings/material particulars \nto show imminent threat to Novartis as a result of launch, by \nZydus/Cadila, of the allegedly infringing product.  \n \n17. \nReferring, \nnext, \nto \nthe \ntwo \npatent \napplications \nIN \n2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625, stated to have been filed by \nCadila for obtaining product and process patents in respect of the \nValsartan-Sacubitril combination, Mr. Lall submits that the \nCommercial Courts Act read with the Delhi High Court Patent Rules \n                                                          \n1(2014) 212 DLT 321 \n2 2009 FC 1209 \n3 (1998) 86 CDR (3d) 36 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

No doubt, as per the provisions of Order \nVII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for the purposes of \ndetermining the question of rejection of plaint on the other grounds \nmentioned therein, it is the plaint that has to be looked into, but the \nquestion is that if the plaintiffs have deliberately suppressed the \nmaterial facts, the disclosure of which is required by law to be \nmade in terms of Order VI, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \nwhether it was open for the Court concerned to proceed with the \ntrial and decide the suit after framing issues. The order dated 20-\n11-2006 was challenged by the plaintiffs-judgment-debtors \nthemselves before this Court and the civil revision was dismissed \nby a reasoned order dated 1-5-2008. Thus, this fact was well \nknown to the plaintiffs and they were duty bound in law to disclose \nthe same which they have not done. Order VI, Rule 2(1) of the \nCode of Civil Procedure clearly stipulates that the pleadings should \ncontain the material facts. It has been observed by the Apex Court \nin Sopan Sukhdeo Sable v. Assistant Charity Commissioner7, that \nomission of a single material fact leads to an incomplete cause of \naction and the statement or plaint becomes bad. Order VII, Rule11 \nof the Code of Civil Procedure lays down an independent remedy \nmade available to the defendant to challenge the maintainability of \nthe suit itself, irrespective of his right to contest the same on \nmerits. The real object of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil \nProcedure is to keep out of Courts irresponsible law suits and in \ncase Court is prima facie persuaded of the view that the suit is an \nabuse of the process of the Court, in the sense that it is a bogus and \nirresponsible litigation, the jurisdiction under Order VII, Rule 11 of \nthe Code of Civil Procedure can be exercised. \n \n11.  \nLaw is well settled that dexterity of the draftsmen whereby \nthe material facts are camouflaged in a cleverly drafted plaint and \nillusionary cause of action is set out, cannot defeat the right of the \ndefendant to get the plaint rejected. In this regard it would be \npertinent to quote the relevant passage of the observation of the \nApex Court in T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal8, as under:  \n \n―We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the \npetitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the Court \nrepeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the \nstatement of the facts found in the judgment of the High \nCourt, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending before \nthe First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant misuse of \nthe mercies of the law in receiving plaints.

He submits that the plaint was predicated \non facts none of which were alleged to be false.  The truth or \notherwise of the allegations in the plaint, points out Mr. Hemant \nSingh, are to be examined during trial, and not in an application under \nOrder VII Rule 11.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                               \n \n(A) \nDocuments to be filed along with the Plaint \n***** \n \n \n(iv) \nDetails of related patent applications/patents to the suit patent, including \ndivisional applications; patents of addition, if any, in India shall be furnished in a \ntabulated form along with their current status; \n \n(v) \nA summary of the patented invention and infringement alleged shall be annexed \neither as a note or as a PowerPoint presentation printed with two slides per image; \n \n(vi) \nExpert report, if any, relied upon by the Plaintiff for infringement analysis; \n \n(vii) \nCopies of all relevant correspondence;‖ \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

A single allegation of patent infringement in the plaint is sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action.\n2. His client had conducted an independent investigation after obtaining knowledge of defendants' trademark and patent applications.\n3. The correctness of the investigation report cannot be determined in an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.\n\n**Arguments**\n\nMr. Singh submits that his client is entitled to set the legal process in motion against the defendants, citing their registration of a trademark (ARNX) for a combination product and patent applications from Cadila Pharmaceuticals.\n\n**Significance of page 11**: This page highlights key arguments presented by Mr. Singh, supporting Novartis's claim of patent infringement. It also underscores the importance of evidence collection and verification in copyright disputes.\n\n**Source**: The PDF file is sourced from \"47. Novartis AG & Anr v.

This single \nallegation, he submits, is sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action \non which the plaint could be maintained.  Whether, in fact, the drug \nthat the defendants were proposing to manufacture would, in fact, \ninfringe the suit patent, was a matter of trial.    \n \n22. \nMr. Singh also submits that his client had not instituted the \nplaint against the defendants merely on a fanciful apprehension.  His \nclient had, consequent to obtaining knowledge of the defendants‘ trade \nmark application and patent applications, conducted an independent \ninvestigation.  \n \n23. \nThe correctness of the investigation report, or the data obtained \nthereby, submits Mr. Singh, cannot be determined in an application \nunder Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. \n \n24. \nHaving thus come across the application of Zydus for \nregistration of the trademark ARNX in respect of a combination, the \npatent applications filed by Cadila, again for a Valsartan-Sacubitril \ncombination, and having been informed by the defendants‘ \nrepresentatives that they were in the process of launching of the \nproduct, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that the law could not possibly \nexpect, much less require, the plaintiff to sit back on its heels without \nsetting the legal process in motion against the defendants.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

Zydus Healthcare Limited & Anr\" (Source: [Anonymous]). \n\nMr. Hemant Singh, representing Novartis AG & Anr., argued that the allegations made by Mr. Lall, which form the basis of the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, exceed the plaint and constitute a defense against it. He referred to para 3 of the defendants' application under Order VII Rule 11.\n\nKey points from page 12:\n\n* Defendant No. 2 has not obtained a manufacturing license from CDSCO.\n* Plaintiffs failed to file an RTI application to verify this information.\n* Allegations in the plaint regarding manufacturing licenses are false and knew by the plaintiffs.\n* Investigation report is incomplete and projects a false cause of action.\n\nDates mentioned: None (date of signing, 12.12.22)",

He has invited my \nattention, in this context, to para 3 of the defendants‘ application \nunder Order VII Rule 11, which reads thus: \n \n―3.  \nIt is respectfully submitted that the present application is \nbeing preferred in view of the patently false statements and \nconcealment in the plaint, which are summarized as under for ease \nof reference, and elaborated in the paragraphs that follow: \n \na.  \nFalse averments regarding manufacture of \nalleged product by the Defendant No 2: It is patently \nfalse and incorrect to allege that Defendant No. 2 has \nobtained a manufacturing licence from CDSCO. It is \nclarified that the Defendants herein have not even applied \nfor such a license, much less obtained the same. No attempt \nto procure such information through a Right to \ninformation(hereinafter referred to as ‗RTI‘) application is \nforthcoming from the plaint. It is submitted that it is usual \npractice to file an RTI application to discern whether a \nDefendant has applied for a manufacturing license, to make \nthe same a cause of action. Filing of RTI applications is a \nmechanism provided by law that, apart from promoting \ntransparency and accountability and empowering citizens, \nprovides concrete proof of Defendant‘s activities and \nassists the Hon‘ble Courts in matters such as the present \nsuit. The Plaintiffs admittedly having various litigation \npending against various companies, are well aware of these \nlegal mechanisms. It is therefore submitted that the absence \nof any attempt to procure credible information on part of \nthe Plaintiffs by a reliable and recognized source is \nconspicuous by its absence, and goes on to show that the \nPlaintiffs are aware that the Defendants have not obtained \nor even applied for such manufacturing license. It is thus \nsubmitted that the contentions and averments in the plaint \nregarding any manufacturing license by the Defendants is \nfalse and the Plaintiffs know them to be false. \n \n \nb.  \nFalse statements in the investigation report and \nincomplete facts: It is submitted that in order to project a \nfalse cause of action, the Plaintiffs have filed an \ninvestigation report that allegedly confirms that the \nDefendant No. 2 has obtained a manufacturing license and \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

Zydus Healthcare Limited & Anr.pdf\" (Source: Neutral Citation Number : 2022/DHC/005462), the court is presented with the following arguments:\n\nThe Plaintiffs, through their investigation report, claim that the Defendants are manufacturing an infringing product in Moriya, Ahmadabad. However, the report has significant flaws, including:\n\n* The report does not mention the names of the employees interviewed or the date, time, and location of the interviews.\n* No pictures or telephonic transcripts of the interviews are included.\n* The report only contains vague quotes from unnamed individuals holding designations such as \"manager\" or \"marketing manager\".\n\nThe Defendants argue that these flaws render the investigation report incompetent and fail to establish a cause of action.\n\nAdditionally, it is pointed out that the Plaintiffs have taken contradictory stands in their contentions:\n\n* On the one hand, they claim a quia timet action (an apprehension of infringement), but on the other hand, the investigation report alleges actual manufacturing by the Defendants.\n\nThe court is to decide whether the Plaintiffs' arguments are sufficient to proceed with the case.",

The aforesaid information has been allegedly \nobtained by the investigation agency by interviewing \ncertain employees of the Defendant companies. However, \nremarkably, the investigation report does not even mention \nthe names of the employees interviewed, or the date or time \nof such interviews, or the place in which these interviews \nwere undertaken, and contains no pictures or telephonic \ntranscripts of any such interviews. The investigation reports \nmerely \nprovides \nincriminating \nquotes \nfrom \npersons(unnamed) holding vague designations such as \n‗manager‘, ‗sales manager‘, ‗marketing manager‘ etc. The \nDefendants companies, admittedly having pan India \npresence and operations, have thousands of such regional \nmanagers and marketing personnel. It is thus submitted that \nthe supposed investigation report has woefully failed to \nestablish a cause of action even on a demurer. It is \nsubmitted that such information can by no stretch of \nimagination become a question of trial owing to the \nabsence of any information provided to corroborate the \ncontentions, and thus, merits rejection at this stage itself. \n \nc.  \nContradictory stands in the contentions of the \nPlaintiffs: Apart from the false statements in the \ninvestigation report, it is submitted that the present suit \ncontains averments that are contradictory to the alleged \nfindings of the investigation report filed by the Plaintiffs \nthemselves. On the one hand the Plaintiffs have premised \ntheir suit as a quia timet action, meaning thereby, that there \nis only an apprehension that the Defendants are undertaking \nany of the activities stated in Section 48 of the Patents Act, \n1970 (making, importing, using, offering for sale or selling) \nand on the other hand, the investigation report alleges that \nthe Defendant No 1 is in fact manufacturing the alleged \nproduct in Moriya. Thus, the Plaintiffs have not placed \ncomplete reliance on the investigation report filed by \nthemselves, since, had the Plaintiffs believed their own \ninvestigation report to be true, the present suit ought to \nhave been an infringement suit based on the alleged \nmanufacture of the product by the Defendants as opposed \nto a quia timet action, and Plaintiffs would have \nsubstantiated their claim of infringement with any valid and \nsubstantial proof obtained during the investigation. \nHowever, being fully aware of the fact that no such \nmanufacturing is taking place at Moriya or anywhere else, \nthe Plaintiffs chose to file a quia timet action to reduce their \nburden of proof and filed along with the plaint an \ninvestigation report making bald averments regarding \nmanufacture of the alleged product.

The Defendants herein reserve their \nright to take appropriate legal action against the Plaintiffs \nas well as the investigation agency Strategic Analysis India \nPvt Ltd (SAI) for making the aforesaid false and baseless \nallegations through a fabricated investigation report. \n \nd.  \nConcealments: It is respectfully submitted that the \ntrade mark application mentioned in the plaint have been \nfiled by the Defendant No. 1 since there was an ongoing \nlicensing talks between the parties. The details of licensing \nnegotiations have been conveniently concealed in the \nplaint. It is submitted that a confidentiality agreement and \nterm sheet had been signed between the parties, clearly \nevincing the approval and signatures of the Plaintiffs, \nwhich has been concealed in the plaint. Thus, the \napplications for the trademark ARNX had been filed in \norder to sell the product under the Defendant No 1‘s trade \nmark and nothing more. It is submitted that despite being in \nthe middle of negotiations, no attempt was made by the \nPlaintiffs to seek any clarification as regards this \napplication, or send a letter/legal notice/email to the \nDefendants. The plaint finds no mention of the \nnegotiations, and has been drafted to project that the \nDefendants have indulged in illegal activities allegedly \nunbeknownst to the Plaintiffs. It is submitted that the \naforesaid facts being material particulars have been \nintentionally concealed and merit no indulgence, since had \nthe same been disclosed, it would have become \nimmediately apparent that there is no cause of action in the \npresent suit. \n \ne.  \nFalse averments regarding patent applications of \nDefendant No2: With respect to the patent application, it is \nclarified that patents are a reward for incremental \ninnovation and improvements on the existing art. Thus, the \nDefendant No 2 has filed a patent application seeking a \npatent on the improvement/innovation on the existing art, \nwhich would be put to test before the appropriate forum. \nThus, by no stretch of imagination can it be said that filing \nof a patent application amounts to infringement of an \nexisting granted patent. Itis submitted that the plaint fails to \ndisclose any averments as to what the patent applications \npertain to, apart from a bald averment that the applications \nhave been filed ―pertaining to different forms of Valsartan \nand Sacubitril‖; or where in the patent applications has the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

Of these, the \nclause that the defendants have chosen to invoke is Clause (a), which \nallows the Court to reject the plaint ―where it does not disclose a cause \nof action‖. \n \n30. \nThe peripheries of the expression ―cause of action‖ stand \ndemarcated in several decisions of the Supreme Court.   \n \n31. \nPara 17 of the report in Kunjan Nair Sivaraman Nair v. \nNarayanan Nair13 approves the following definition, contained in \nHalsbury‘s Laws of England: \n― ―Cause of action‖ has been defined as meaning simply a factual \nsituation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from \nthe Court a remedy against another person. The phrase has been \nheld from earliest time to include every fact which is material to be \nproved to entitle the plaintiff to succeed, and every fact which a \ndefendant would have a right to traverse.

It must include some act done by \nthe defendant since in the absence of such an act, no cause \nof action can possibly accrue. It is not limited to the actual \ninfringement of the right sued on but includes all the \nmaterial facts on which it is founded.‖  \n(emphasis supplied) \n \n24.2. In T. Arivandandam8 this Court held that while considering \nan application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC what is required to be \ndecided is whether the plaint discloses a real cause of action, or \nsomething purely illusory, in the following words : - \n \n―5. …The learned Munsiff must remember that if on a \nmeaningful – not formal – reading of the plaint it is \nmanifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not \ndisclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his \npower under O. VII, R. 11, C.P.C. taking care to see that \nthe ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever \ndrafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it \nin the bud at the first hearing …‖ \n (emphasis supplied)  \n24.3. Subsequently, in I.T.C.

The \nCourt must be vigilant against any camouflage or suppression, and \ndetermine whether the litigation is utterly vexatious, and an abuse \nof the process of the court.‖ \n \n40. \nRajendra Bajoria28, which followed Dahiben11, held, with \nrespect to Order VII Rule 11, thus: \n―13. \nNo doubt that, it is rightly contended on behalf of the \nplaintiffs that, only on the basis of the averments made in the \nplaint, it could be ascertained as to whether a cause of action is  \nmade out or not. It is equally true that for finding out the same, the \nentire pleadings in the plaint will have to be read and that too, at \ntheir face value. At this stage, the defence taken by the defendants \ncannot be looked into. \n \n14.  \nWe may gainfully refer to the observations of this Court in \nthe case of T. Arivandandam8: \n \n―5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning the \npetitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the court \nrepeatedly and unrepentently resorted to. From the \nstatement of the facts found in the judgment of the High \nCourt, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending before \nthe First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant misuse of \nthe mercies of the law in receiving plaints. The learned \nMunsif must remember that if on a meaningful — not \nformal — reading of the plaint it is manifestly vexatious, \nand meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to \nsue, he should exercise his power under Order 7, Rule 11 \nCPC taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein \nis fulfilled. And, if clever drafting has created the illusion \nof a cause of action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by \nexamining the party searchingly under Order 10, CPC. An \nactivist Judge is the    answer to irresponsible law suits. \nThe trial courts would insist imperatively on examining \nthe party at the first hearing so that bogus litigation can be \nshot down at the earliest stage. The Penal Code is also \nresourceful enough to meet such men, (Cr. XI) and must \nbe triggered against them.

The court has also held that if none of the reliefs sought in the plaint can be granted to the plaintiff under the law, the question arises as to whether such a suit should continue and go for trial.\n\nThe court affirmed its previous decision and set aside the order passed by the High Court, which had remanded the suit for trial. The plaintiffs' reliance on judgment Dahiben was deemed inapplicable, and the defendants' argument was supported instead.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Order VII Rule 11 of CPC allows the court to dismiss a suit if no cause of action is disclosed or the suit is barred by limitation.\n* If pleadings are manifestly vexatious and meritless, the court can exercise its power to dismiss the suit.\n* A suit should be thrown out at the threshold if none of the reliefs sought in the plaint can be granted under the law.\n\nSource: 47.

It has been held that if clever drafting has created the \nillusion of a cause of action, and a meaningful reading thereof \nwould show that the pleadings are manifestly vexatious and \nmeritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, then the \ncourt should exercise its power under Order VII Rule 11 of CPC. It \nhas been held that such a suit has to be nipped in the bud at the first \nhearing itself. \n \n***** \n17. \nIt could thus be seen that the court has to find out as to \nwhether in the background of the facts, the relief, as claimed in the \nplaint, can be granted to the plaintiff. It has been held that if the \ncourt finds that none of the reliefs sought in the plaint  can be \ngranted to the plaintiff under the law, the question then arises is as \nto whether such a suit is to be allowed to continue and go for trial. \nThis Court answered the said question by holding that such a suit \nshould be thrown out at the threshold.  This Court, therefore, \nupheld the order passed by the trial court of rejecting the suit and \nthat of the appellate court, thereby affirming the decision of the \ntrial court. This Court set aside the order passed by the High Court, \nwherein the High Court had set aside the concurrent orders of the \ntrial court and the appellate court and had restored and remanded \nthe suit for trial to the trial court. \n***** \n19. \nWe are in complete agreement with the findings of the High \nCourt. Insofar as the reliance placed by Shri Jain on the judgment \nof this Court in the case of Dahiben11, to which one of us (L. \nNageswara Rao, J.) was a member, is concerned, in our view, the \nsaid judgment rather than supporting the case of the plaintiffs, \nwould support the case of the defendants.  Paragraphs 23.3, 23.4, \n23.5 and 23.6 in the case of Dahiben11 read thus: \n \n―23.3.  \nThe underlying object of Order 7 Rule 11(a) \nis that if in a suit, no cause of action is disclosed, or the \nsuit is barred by limitation under Rule 11(d), the court \nwould not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the \nproceedings in the suit. In such a case, it would be \nnecessary to put an end to the sham litigation, so that \nfurther judicial time is not wasted. \n \n23.4.

The averments of the plaint have to be read as a \nwhole to find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action \nor whether the suit is barred by any law. It is needless to observe \nthat the question as to whether the suit is barred by any law, would \nalways depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

Even when the allegations \nmade in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their face \nvalue, if they show that the suit is barred by any law, or do not \ndisclose cause of action, the application for rejection of plaint can \nbe entertained and the power under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC can be \nexercised.

Mr Lall has relied on the observations in Teva Pharmaceutical \nIndustries1 in this regard.   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries1 holds \nthat (i) a quia timet action ―cannot be brought on speculation in the \nhope that sufficient facts may be gleaned on discovery that will \nsupport the allegations made in the pleadings‖, and (ii) ―the statement \nof claim must allege a deliberate expressed intention to engage in \nactivity the result of which would raise a strong possibility of \ninfringement; the activity to be engaged must be alleged to be \nimminent and the resulting damage to the plaintiff must be alleged to \nbe very substantial if not irreparable; and, finally, the facts pleaded \nmust be cogent, precise and material‖.  The plaint, therefore, is only \nrequired to allege. Proving of the allegations has to be left to trial.  A \nplaint, which so alleges, cannot be thrown out under Order VII Rule \n11 on the ground that the allegations have no merit, or that the \nmaterial placed on record with the plaint is not sufficient to prove the \nallegation.  That said, the decision also cautions that the quia timet \naction must not be merely speculative, merely alleging without the \nfactual basis for the allegation made known.  Equally, the facts \npleaded must be cogent, precise and material.   \n \n50. \nWhat has to be seen, therefore, in assessing whether a quia \ntimet plaint can be rejected outright under Order VII Rule 11, is \n(i) \nwhether the plaint alleges  \n(a) \na deliberate expressed intention to engage in \nactivity the result of which would raise a strong \npossibility of infringement, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

This \ninterpretation would be consistent with the amplitude of the words \nused in Section 129 CPC by which the High Court is empowered to \nmake rules ―not inconsistent with the Letters Patent to regulate its \nown procedure in the exercise of its original jurisdiction as it shall \nthink fit‖. \n \n63. \nIn 38 of the report in state of State of Madhya Pradesh v. \nNarmada Bachao Andolan45, the legal position with respect to \ninterpretation of the expression ―as far as possible‖ was clarified still \nfurther, thus: \n― “As far as possible” \n \n38.  \nThe aforesaid phrase provides for flexibility, clothing the \nauthority concerned with powers to meet special situations where \nthe normal process of resolution cannot flow smoothly. The \naforesaid phrase can be interpreted as not being prohibitory in \nnature. The said words rather connote a discretion vested in the \nprescribed authority. It is thus discretion and not compulsion. There \nis no hard-and-fast rule in this regard as these words give a \ndiscretion to the authority concerned. Once the authority exercises \nits discretion, the court should not interfere with the said \ndiscretion/decision unless it is found to be palpably arbitrary. \n(Vide Iridium India Telecom Ltd.43 and High Court of Judicature \nfor Rajasthan v. Veena Verma46 ) Thus, it is evident that this \nphrase simply means that the principles are to be observed unless it \nis not possible to follow the same in the particular circumstances of \na case.‖ \n \n64. \nEtymologically, the expressions ―to the extent possible‖ and ―as \nfar as possible‖ are synonymous. The aforesaid decisions which lay \ndown the principles for interpretation of the expression ―as far as \npossible‖ would, therefore, apply equally to interpretation of the \nexpression ―to the extent possible‖. \n                                                          \n45 (2011) 7 SCC 639 \n46(2009) 14 SCC 734  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

This reasoning would apply, \nmutatis mutandis, to Rule 4(A) of the Delhi High Court Patent Rules10 \nas well, which, too, requires the documents enumerated in the Rule to \nbe filed with the plaint ―to the extent possible‖. \n \n66. \nPatent legislation is, in a manner of speaking, sui generis and \nthe compulsions and considerations that guide such legislation are \noften unique.  The use of the expression ―to the extent possible‖ is, \ntherefore, cautious, circumspect and well-guided, and, if the Court \nwere to hold the provisions of Rule 3(A) and 4(A) to be mandatory, \nand a plaint that does not conform to the protocol envisaged by the \nsaid provisions to be vulnerable to rejection under Order VII Rule 11, \nthe Court may well be militating against the intent of the Rule makers \nin incorporating the ―to the extent possible‖ caveat.  There may be any \nnumber of reasons why it is not possible to adhere to the disclosure \nregime envisaged by Rule 3(A) of the Delhi High Court Patent Rules, \nincluding, inter alia, considerations of confidentiality and practical \nimpossibility.  It cannot be said that the mere accessibility, or \navailability, of the details envisaged by Rules 3(A) or 4(A) would, in \nevery case, make it possible to place the said details on record.  The \nRule makers have, therefore, consciously required compliance with \nthe protocol prescribed in Rule 3(A) only to the extent possible.

Where \nprescriptive stipulations do not also prescribe the sanction which \nwould follow on their violation, the prescription is to be regarded, \nordinarily, as directory, rather than mandatory.  The position in law, in \nthis regard, is elucidated, without any equivocation whatsoever, in the \nfollowing passages from Rani Kusum v. Kanchan Devi47: \n―9.  \nOrder 8 Rule 1 after the amendment casts an obligation on \nthe defendant to file the written statement within 30 days from the \ndate of service of summons on him and within the extended time \nfalling within 90 days. The provision does not deal with the power \nof the court and also does not specifically take away the power of \nthe court to take the written statement on record though filed \nbeyond the time as provided for. Further, the nature of the \nprovision contained in Order 8 Rule 1 is procedural. It is not a part \nof the substantive law. The substituted Order 8 Rule 1 intends to \ncurb the mischief of unscrupulous defendants adopting dilatory \ntactics, delaying the disposal of cases causing inconvenience to \nplaintiffs and petitioners approaching the court for quick relief and \nalso to the serious inconvenience of the court faced with frequent \nprayers for adjournments. The object is to expedite the hearing and \nnot to scuttle the same. While justice delayed may amount to justice \ndenied, justice hurried may in some cases amount to justice buried. \n \n10.  \nAll the rules of procedure are the handmaid of justice. The \nlanguage employed by the draftsman of processual law may be \nliberal or stringent, but the fact remains that the object of \nprescribing procedure is to advance the cause of justice. In an \nadversarial system, no party should ordinarily be denied the \nopportunity of participating in the process of justice dispensation. \nUnless compelled by express and specific language of the statute, \nthe provisions of CPC or any other procedural enactment ought \nnot to be construed in a manner which would leave the court \nhelpless to meet extraordinary situations in the ends of justice. \n \n11.  \nThe mortality of justice at the hands of law troubles a \njudge's conscience and points an angry interrogation at the law \nreformer. \n \n12.  \nThe processual law so dominates in certain systems as to \noverpower substantive rights and substantial justice. The humanist \nrule that procedure should be the handmaid, not the mistress, of \n                                                          \n47 (2005) 6 SCC 705 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

Justice is the goal of \njurisprudence, processual, as much as substantive. (See Sushil \nKumar Sen v. State of Bihar48 ) \n \n13.  \nNo person has a vested right in any course of procedure. He \nhas only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner for the \ntime being by or for the court in which the case is pending, and if, \nby an Act of Parliament the mode of procedure is altered, he has no \nother right than to proceed according to the altered mode. \n(See Blyth v. Blyth49 ) A procedural law should not ordinarily be \nconstrued as mandatory; the procedural law is always subservient \nto and is in aid to justice. Any interpretation which eludes or \nfrustrates the recipient of justice is not to be followed. \n(See Shreenath v. Rajesh50 ) \n \n14.  \nProcessual law is not to be a tyrant but a servant, not an \nobstruction but an aid to justice. Procedural prescriptions are the \nhandmaid and not the mistress, a lubricant, not a resistant in the \nadministration of justice. \n \n15.  \nIt is also to be noted that though the power of the court \nunder the proviso appended to Rule 1 Order 8 is circumscribed by \nthe words “shall not be later than ninety days” but the \nconsequences flowing from non-extension of time are not \nspecifically provided for though they may be read in by necessary \nimplication. Merely because a provision of law is couched in a \nnegative language implying mandatory character, the same is not \nwithout exceptions. The courts, when called upon to interpret the \nnature of the provision, may, keeping in view the entire context in \nwhich the provision came to be enacted, hold the same to be \ndirectory though worded in the negative form. \n \n16.  \nChallenge to the constitutional validity of the Amendment \nAct and the 1999 Amendment Act was rejected by this Court \nin Salem Advocate Bar Assn. v.

The point for consideration \nis whether the provision providing for maximum period of \nninety days is mandatory and, therefore, the court is \naltogether powerless to extend the time even in an \nexceptionally hard case. \n \n16.  \nIt has been common practice for the parties to take \nlong adjournments for filing written statements.

It highlights that construction should not be overly rigid or dogmatic to ensure natural justice is served.\n\nThe court cites the case Topline Shoes Ltd. v. Corpn. Bank (2002) 6 SCC 33, where it was held that a provision may be considered directory if its object is to expedite the hearing of cases and avoid unnecessary adjournments. The court notes that procedural laws are made to advance justice, not defeat it.\n\nThe key arguments mentioned in this excerpt include:\n\n* Natural justice requires men to not be condemned unheard and decisions should not be taken behind their backs.\n* Exceptions are permitted where clearly defined, but the general rule is to construe procedures in light of natural justice.\n* The use of the word \"shall\" alone does not determine whether a provision is mandatory or directory.\n\n(PDF source: 47.

It was held that the intention to provide a time-frame \nto file reply is really made to expedite the hearing of such \nmatters and avoid unnecessary adjournments. It was \nnoticed that no penal consequences had been prescribed if \nthe reply is not filed in the prescribed time. The provision \nwas held to be directory. It was observed that the provision \nis more by way of procedure to achieve the object of speedy \ndisposal of the case. \n \n20.  \nThe use of the word „shall‟ in Order 8 Rule 1 by \nitself is not conclusive to determine whether the provision is \nmandatory or directory. We have to ascertain the object \nwhich is required to be served by this provision and its \ndesign and context in which it is enacted. The use of the \nword „shall‟ is ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of \nthe provision but having regard to the context in which it is \nused or having regard to the intention of the legislation, the \nsame can be construed as directory.

The rules of procedure are the handmaid of \njustice and not its mistress. In the present context, the strict \ninterpretation would defeat justice. \n \n21.  \nIn construing this provision, support can also be \nhad from Order 8 Rule 10 which provides that where any \nparty from whom a written statement is required under \nRule 1 or Rule 9, fails to present the same within the time \npermitted or fixed by the court, the court shall pronounce \njudgment against him, or make such other order in relation \nto the suit as it thinks fit. On failure to file written statement \nunder this provision, the court has been given the discretion \neither to pronounce judgment against the defendant or \nmake such other order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. \nIn the context of the provision, despite use of the word \n„shall‟, the court has been given the discretion to \npronounce or not to pronounce the judgment against the \ndefendant even if written statement is not filed and instead \npass such order as it may think fit in relation to the suit. In \nconstruing the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 and Rule 10, the \ndoctrine of harmonious construction is required to be \napplied. The effect would be that under Rule 10 of Order 8, \nthe court in its discretion would have the power to allow \nthe defendant to file written statement even after expiry of \nthe period of 90 days provided in Order 8 Rule 1. There is \nno restriction in Order 8 Rule 10 that after expiry of ninety \ndays, further time cannot be granted. The court has wide \npower to „make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks \nfit‟. Clearly, therefore, the provision of Order 8 Rule 1 \nproviding for the upper limit of 90 days to file written \nstatement is directory. Having said so, we wish to make it \nclear that the order extending time to file written statement \ncannot be made in routine. The time can be extended only \nin exceptionally hard cases. While extending time, it has to \nbe borne in mind that the legislature has fixed the upper \ntime-limit of 90 days. The discretion of the court to extend \nthe time shall not be so frequently and routinely exercised \nso as to nullify the period fixed by Order 8 Rule 1.‖ \n(emphasis in original) \n \n17.  \nThe Bench in JT para 54 after considering the Committee's \nReport has observed as follows : (SCC p. 374, para 50) \n \n―50.  \nHaving regard to the constitutional obligation to \nprovide fair, quick and speedy justice, we direct the Central \nGovernment to examine the aforesaid suggestions and \nsubmit a report to this Court within four months.‖ \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

The conclusions have been summed up in SCC para 46. The \nrelevant portion reads as follows : (SCC pp. 500-01) \n \n―46. (iv) The purpose of providing the time schedule for \nfiling the written statement under Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is to \nexpedite and not to scuttle the hearing. The provision spells \nout a disability on the defendant. It does not impose an \nembargo on the power of the court to extend the time. \nThough the language of the proviso to Rule 1 Order 8 CPC \nis couched in negative form, it does not specify any penal \nconsequences flowing from the non-compliance. The \nprovision being in the domain of the procedural law, it has \nto be held directory and not mandatory. The power of the \ncourt to extend time for filing the written statement beyond \nthe time schedule provided by Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is not \ncompletely taken away. \n \n(v)  \nThough Order 8 Rule 1 CPC is a part of procedural \nlaw and hence directory, keeping in view the need for \nexpeditious trial of civil causes which persuaded Parliament \nto enact the provision in its present form, it is held that \nordinarily the time schedule contained in the provision is to \nbe followed as a rule and departure therefrom would be by \nway of exception. A prayer for extension of time made by \nthe defendant shall not be granted just as a matter of routine \nand merely for the asking, more so when the period of 90 \ndays has expired. Extension of time may be allowed by way \nof an exception, for reasons to be assigned by the defendant \nand also be placed on record in writing, howsoever briefly, \nby the court on its being satisfied. Extension of time may be \nallowed if it is needed to be given for circumstances which \nare exceptional, occasioned by reasons beyond the control \nof the defendant and grave injustice would be occasioned if \nthe time was not extended. Costs may be imposed and \naffidavit or documents in support of the grounds pleaded by \nthe defendant for extension of time may be demanded, \ndepending on the facts and circumstances of a given case.‖ \n \n68. \nNon-compliance with the protocol prescribed in Rule 3(A) of \nthe Delhi High Court Patent Rules cannot, therefore, be cited as a \nground to reject a plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. \n                                                          \n56 (2005) 4 SCC 480 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:12.12.2022\n16:54:10\nSignature Not Verified",

          "summary": "From page 44 of the PDF \"47. Novartis AG & Anr v. Zydus Healthcare Limited & Anr\" (2022/DHC/005462):\n\nThe court is considering whether to dismiss the plaint for lack of a cause of action under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.\n\nMr. Lall, appearing for the defendant (Zydus), argues that the plaintiff's (Novartis) allegations in the plaint are \"artful drafting\" and do not actually establish a cause of action. He points out that Novartis has not provided details about patent applications IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 filed by Cadila, which would expose the plaint as lacking a cause of action.\n\nThe court disagrees with Mr. Lall's argument, holding that the existence or non-existence of a cause of action should be determined solely on the basis of allegations in the plaint. The plaint alleges a specific patent for a combination of Valsartan and Sacubitril, which is similar to Cadila's pending patent applications. This suffices to justify the present case.\n\nLegal facts:\n\n* Court: High Court of Delhi\n* Case number: CS(COMM) 681/2021\n* PDF source: \"47. Novartis AG & Anr v.

He \nsubmits that the present case was an instance of such ―artful drafting‖ \nwhereby Novartis was setting up a cause of action where there was, in \nreality, none. He juxtaposes this submission with his submission that \nthe plaintiff had not placed on record the details of the patent \napplications IN 2655MUM2015 and IN 201621044625 filed by \nCadila. Had he done so, Mr. Lall submits that Novartis would \nadditionally have to map the suit patent to the said patents, which \nwould expose the plaint as being bereft of any cause of action. \n \n70. \nThe argument, in my view, is stretching the limits of Order VII \nRule 11(a) of the CPC to an unacceptable degree. The existence, or \nnon-existence, of a cause of action to base a plaint, for the purposes of \nOrder VII Rule 11(a) has, it may be reiterated, to be determined solely \non the basis of the allegations in the plaint. If the assertions and \nallegations in the plaint, even if proved and established by the \nplaintiff, do not make out a case for grant, to the plaintiff, of the relief \nsought in the plaint, it may be said that the plaint is bereft of a cause \nof action and merits rejection under Order VII Rule 11(a). The present \ncase does not, however, make out any such case for rejection. The suit \npatent asserted in the plaint is specifically for a combination of \nValsartan and Sacubitril. The patent applications IN 2655MUM2015 \nand IN 201621044625 filed by Cadila were also for a combination for \nValsartan and Sacubitril.
