    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: Manu Garg and Ratan Behari Agrawal v. Registrar of Trademarks**\n\n**Background:**\nThe case involves a trademark application filed by the appellant, Manu Garg and Ratan Behari Agrawal (\"the Appellants\"), for registration of the word mark \"COCK\" under Class 28 of the NICE classification. The Appellants sought to register the mark for water and colour pistols, guns, and sprayers used to spray colours during festivals such as Holi.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe Appellants' application was objected to by the Senior Examiner of Trademarks in a First Examination Report (FER) dated 13th March 2018. The objections were based on two marks already registered with the Registrar of Trademarks:\n\n1. \"COCK\" mark of Mr. A.S. Chinna Nadar (\"Chinna Nadar\"), which was used for goods similar or allied to water and colour pistols.\n2. Mark by Mr. Lokesh Kataria, Gurgaon, but later rejected by the learned Registrar.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* The Appellants' counsel, Mr. M.K. Miglani, argued that the objection of the Senior Examiner was misconceived as the Chinna Nadar's registered mark \"COCK\" was for amorces or paper caps for toy pistols and not for water and colour pistols.\n* Mr. Miglani also highlighted the difference in nature between the goods related to the Appellants' application (water guns) and those under Chinna Nadar's registration (fireworks-related).\n* Further, it was pointed out that an \"amorce\" is a percussion cap designed for use in toys.\n\n**Court Findings:**\nThe Court observed:\n\n1. The objection by the Senior Examiner predicated on Chinna Nadar's mark alone survives as Mr. Lokesh Kataria's application was later rejected.\n2. The Appellants' reply, dated 2nd April 2018, highlighted that the registration of \"COCK\" by Chinna Nadar was for amorces or paper caps for toy pistols and not related to water and colour pistols.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe Court found in favour of the Appellants and allowed their appeal against the rejection of the trademark application. The Court agreed with the Appellants' arguments that there was no similarity between the goods covered by the registered mark \"COCK\" (amorces) and those sought to be registered (water and colour pistols). Therefore, the registration would not cause confusion or deception.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe decision of the High Court of Delhi in this case highlights the importance of carefully analyzing trademark objections and distinguishing between similar-sounding marks with different goods or services. In this instance, the Court recognized that no consumer confusion was likely to occur when comparing \"COCK\" for amorces (fireworks-related) versus water and colour pistols.\n\n**Date:** 01st February 2023\n\n**Judgment by**: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C.HARI SHANKAR",

JUSTICE C.HARI SHANKAR \n \n \n \n \n    JUDGMENT(ORAL) \n% \n \n \n           01.02.2023 \n \n1. \nThe appellant is aggrieved by order dated 4th February 2021, \npassed by the learned Senior Examiner of Trademarks in the office of \nthe Registrar of Trademarks, whereby Application No. 3757855 of the \nappellant has been rejected by the learned Senior Examiner. \n \n2. \nWritten submissions by way of response to the appeal have \nbeen filed by the respondent. I have heard Mr. Miglani, learned \nCounsel for the appellant and Mr. Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar, \nlearned Counsel for the respondent. \n \nFacts \n \n3. \nApplication No. 3757855 was submitted by the appellant for \nregistration of the word mark “COCK” under Class 28 of the NICE \nclassification as adopted by Rule 20 of the Trademarks Rules 2017, \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 2 of 13 \n \nfor “water and colour pistols, water and colour guns, water and colour \nsprayers, being toys included in Class 28”. Mr. Miglani points out that \nthe goods in respect of which the impugned mark was sought to be \nregistered were pistols in the nature of “pichkaris” (water guns), used \nin festivals such as Holi for spraying colours. He submits that, even if \nakin in shape to guns, the water and colour pistols made by the \nappellant have nothing in common with fireworks, with which, \ntraditionally, guns are associated.  They, therefore, are guns merely in \nform, not in substance.   \n \n4. \nConsequent to filing of the aforesaid application by the \nappellant, the learned Senior Examiner in the office of the Registrar of \nTrademarks, vide First Examination Report (FER) dated 13th March \n2018, objected to the grant of registration for the appellants COCK \nmark, citing two marks which, according to him, were identical and \nused for goods which were similar or allied to the goods in respect of \nwhich registration was sought by the appellant.  The proprietors, in \nwhose favour the said marks were registered, were Mr. A.S. Chinna \nNadar (“Chinna Nadar”, hereinafter), Sivakasi and Mr. Lokesh \nKataria, Gurgaon. \n \n5. \nOf these, at the time when the FER was issued, the COCK mark \nof Mr. Lokesh Kataria was under objections. Subsequently, the \napplication of Mr. Kataria stands rejected by the learned Registrar.  As \nsuch, the objection of the learned Senior Examiner, predicated on the \nCOCK registration granted to Chinna Nadar alone survives for \nconsideration.  This position has already stands noted in the order \ndated 23rd May 2022 passed in the present proceedings. \n \n6. \nOn receiving the aforesaid FER, the appellant, vide reply dated \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 3 of 13 \n \n2nd April 2018, submitted that the objection of the learned Senior \nExaminer was misconceived, as the COCK brand registered in favour \nof Chinna Nadar was for “amorces or paper caps for toy pistols”, \nwhereas the appellant was seeking registration of the COCK mark for \nwater and colour pistols, guns and sprayers used to spray colours \nduring festivals such as Holi.  It was also pointed out that the mark \nwhich stood registered in favour of Chinna Nadar was the device mark \n which clearly indicated that the registration was for amorces \nand for no other goods. The registration sought by the appellant was, \non the other hand, for toy pistols used to spray colours, which had \nnothing in common with amorces.  An “amorce”, as Mr. Miglani \npoints out from the dictionary, is a percussion cap for a toy pistol. \nElsewhere, the expression “amorce” is defined as “a firework which is \na percussion cap designed for use in toys, which comprises of paper \nenvelope containing a dot of impact sensitive pyrotechnic composition \nand which forms part of a roll”. \n \n7. \nI may note, here, that, in India, such rolls, which are fitted in toy \npistols, are often used by children on the occasion of festivals such as \nDiwali. These rolls are often mounted on pistols between the striking \nsurface and the body of the pistol so that, when the pistol is cocked \nand fired, due to the impact of the strike, a small spark is emitted with \na noise imitative of a bullet being fired.  Amorces are available in rolls \nor in individual pieces.   \n \n8. \nThe appellant’s objection was not accepted by the learned \nSenior Examiner who has, by the impugned order dated 4th February \n2021, rejected the appellant’s application.  The impugned order reads \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 4 of 13 \n \nthus: \n“Instant mark is phonetically and visually identical to the \nconflicting marks which is mentioned in the search report and also \nthey are well in prior use in respect of the similar nature of goods \nwhich sought by the applicant. The applicant is the well subsequent \nuser among the conflicting mark user period. In view of these \ngrounds, the Tribunal has opined that the applicant has deliberately \nchosen the subject mark in an effort to ride upon the goodwill and \nreputation of the conflicting marks. Applicant has no bona fide \nadoption of the subject mark in respect of the applied goods. \nFurther, the allowance of the subject mark is patently mala fide \nsince the mark has been dishonestly adopted by the applicant hence \nthe applicant cannot claim to be the proprietor of the subject mark \nunder Section 18(1) of the Act. Allowance of the subject mark is \nadversely affecting the interest of the public; it would lead to \nconfusion as it is more than likely, due to imperfect recollection \nthat the average buyer may confuse the applicant’s mark “COCK” \nas the conflicting owner’s product sold under “COCK”. In view of \nsuch similarities between the nature of the marks and their goods, \nthe applicant’s trade channel and counters, there exists a strong \nlikelihood of confusions on the part of the consuming public, \nincluding an association, as they are likely to assume and confuse \nthat the applicant’s goods are connected or otherwise associated \nwith the conflicting marks goods, when no such connection exists. \nConsequently, the members of the trade would no doubt, be under \nthe mistaken belief that the applicant’s goods originate from the \nconflicting mark or that they have some trade connection or \naffiliation thereby causing irreparable loss and damage not only to \nthe conflicting mark trade and business but also suiting erosion of \ndistinctiveness hard earned by the conflicting marks. \n \nIn addition to the facts of the subject application, I want to \ndiscuss the land mark case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila \nPharmaceuticals1 wherein the Supreme Court has stated that in an \naction for passing off on the basis of unregistered trade mark \ngenerally the following factors have to be considered for deciding \nthe question of deceptive similarity of marks: \n \n(a) \nThe nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks \nare word marks or label marks or composite marks i.e. \nboth words and label marks \n \n(b) \nThe degree of resemblances between the marks, \nphonetically similar and hence similar in idea. \n \n(c) \nThe nature of the goods in respect or which \nthey are used as trade marks. \n \n(d) \nThe similarity in the nature, character and \n                                          \n1 AIR 2001 SC 1952 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 5 of 13 \n \nperformance of the goods or the rival traders. \n \n(e) \nThe class of purchasers who are likely to buy \nthe goods bearing the marks they require, on their \neducation and intelligence and a degree of care they are \nlikely to exercise in purchasing and or using the goods. \n \n(f) \nThe mode of purchasing the goods or placing \norders for the goods, and \n \n(g) \nAny other surrounding circumstances which \nmay be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between \nthe competing marks. \n \nWeightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors \ndepends upon facts of each case and the same weightage cannot be \ngiven to each factor in every case. \n \nBased upon the Supreme Court guidelines, the above \nmentioned seven factors are obviously applicable to this case. In \norder to avoid the opposition to the registration as well as passing \noff actions against the subject mark, the Tribunal is not ready to \naccept the subject mark for journal publication. \n \nIn this position, I would like to enlighten the object of the \nTrade Marks Act, 1999. The said object is to provide for \nregistration and better protection of trade marks for goods and \nservices and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks. If \nthe subject mark is allowed for registration, the object of the Trade \nMarks Act, 1999 would be jeopardized and the purity of the \nRegister will be affected. \n \nIn view of the above said reasons, the Trade Mark \nApplication is refused under sections 11(1)(a) and (b) of the Trade \nMarks Act, 1999.” \n \nRival Contentions \n \n9. \nMr. Miglani submits that the impugned order is misconceived. \nThe finding of the learned Senior Examiner that the use, of the COCK \nmark registered in favour of Chinna Nadar was for goods which were \nsimilar to those in respect of which registration was being sought by \nthe appellant is, he submits, erroneous on facts.  The goods in respect \nof which the appellant was seeking registration, and the goods in \nrespect of which the COCK brand stood registered in favour of  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 6 of 13 \n \nChinna Nadar, he submits, are completely different.  \n \n10. \nIn fact, submits Mr. Miglani, the appellant stands registered for \nuse of the COCK brand for colours since 1992.  The appellant had \nearlier been issued a legal notice dated 19th February 2018 by Sri \nKaliswari Fireworks, of which Chinna Nadar was admittedly the \nDirector, objecting to the use, by the appellant, of its COCK label.  \nThe appellant had replied to the said legal notice on 17th March 2018, \nsubmitting that, whereas the appellant’s COCK mark was used for \nHoli colours, gulal and like goods, Chinna Nadar’s mark was used for \nfireworks, sparklers, crackers, ground wheels, rockets, colour matches \netc. Mr. Miglani points out that, on the said reply being submitted by \nhis client, Sri Kaliswari Fireworks had, by its communication dated \n30th January 2019, expressed satisfaction with the reply of the \nappellant. \n \n11. \nThe goods in respect of which the appellant was now seeking \nregistration of the COCK brand are, submits Mr. Miglani, goods \nwhich are used for spraying the very colours in respect of which the \nCOCK brand already stands registered in the appellant’s favour since \n1992.  Chinna Nadar has already expressed his satisfaction with the \nuse of the said mark by the appellant for colours.  As such, he submits, \nthe learned Senior Examiner acted unreasonably in refusing \nregistration to the appellant, for the mark “COCK” in respect of water \nand colour pistols, guns and sprayers, under Class 28. \n \n12. \nMr. Vaidyanathan, learned Counsel for the respondent, on the \nother hand, supports the impugned order.  He submits that the COCK \nmark registered in favour of Mr. A.S. Chinna Nadar is also used for \ntoy pistols.  The mere fact that toy pistols in which the said amorces \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 7 of 13 \n \nwere used, were normally used in Diwali, whereas the toy pistols for \nwhich the appellant was seeking registration are used in Holi and like \nfestivals, he submits, cannot make a substantial difference or justify \ninterference with the impugned order which is well-reasoned.  He \nsubmits that the goods in respect of which registration was being \nsought by the appellant, and the goods in respect of which the COCK \nbrand was registered in favour of Chinna Nadar were both used in \nfestival celebrations.  As such, he submits that both the items would \nbe available from similar small shops and that it was a matter of \ncommon knowledge that festivals such as Durga Pooja, spraying of \ncolours and fireworks both took place.  As such, Mr. Vaidyanathan \nsubmits that the learned Senior Examiner cannot be faulted in refusing \nregistration to the appellant’s mark. \n \nAnalysis \n \n13. \nI have heard learned Counsel and perused the material on \nrecord. \n \n14. \nSection 11 of the Trade Marks Act provides “relative grounds \nfor refusal of registration”, as against “absolute grounds for refusal” \nenvisaged by Section 9.  The grounds for refusal, contained in Section \n11, essentially relate to earlier marks registered in favour of someone \nelse, or for which an application is pending with the office of the \nRegistrar of Trademarks.  We are concerned with Section 11(1)2. \n                                          \n2 11.  \nRelative grounds for refusal of registration. –  \n(1)  \nSave as provided in Section 12, a trade mark shall not be registered if, because of –  \n(a)  \nits identity with an earlier trade mark and similarity of goods or services \ncovered by the trade mark; or \n(b)  \nits similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods \nor services covered by the trade mark, \nthere exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, which includes the likelihood of \nassociation with the earlier trade mark. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 8 of 13 \n \n15. \nSection 11(1)(a) prohibits registration of a trademark which is \nidentical to an earlier trademark and used in respect of similar goods \nor services, whereas Section 11(1)(b) prohibits registration of a \ntrademark which is similar to an earlier trademark and used in respect \nof identical or similar goods or services.  In either case, there must, \nadditionally, exist a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, \nfor registration to be refused under Section 11(1). The provision also \nclarifies that “confusion” would include likelihood of association with \nthe earlier trademark. \n \n16. \nHaving heard learned Counsel for both sides and applied my \nmind thereto, I am unable to subscribe to the view of the learned \nSenior Examiner that the goods, in respect of which registration of the \nCOCK word mark was being sought by the appellant, were similar to \nthe goods in respect of which the COCK device mark stood registered \nin favour of Chinna Nadar.  Mr Vaidyanathan’s submission that toy \npistols are toy pistols, I feel, oversimplifies the issue.  The “guns”, or \n“pistols”, for which the appellant sought registration of the COCK \nmark, are guns or pistols merely in form, not in substance.  They emit \nneither heat nor light.  They are not, therefore, fireworks in any sense \nof the expression.  They emit – if one may use the expression – not \nfire, but its antithesis; water.  A gun which sprays water and a gun \nwhich emits a spark and, therefore, releases heat and light are about as \nalike as chalk and cheese.  The fact that they may both be used on \nsimilar occasions does not make them like, similar, or allied, even in \nordinary parlance.   \n \n17. \nThe appellant seeks registration of the COCK word mark.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 9 of 13 \n \nChinna Nadar holds a registration for the \n device mark.  \nChinna Nadar’s mark is a composite device mark which includes, \napart from the words “COCK BRAND”, the word “AMORCES”.   \n \n18. \nBesides, Chinna Nadar’s registration was specifically for \n“amorces or paper caps for toy pistols”.  As such, the mark was not \neven registered for toy pistols per se, but only for amerces used in toy \npistols.  The appellant’s request for registration could not, therefore, \nhave been refused on the ground that the COCK brand stood \nregistered in favour of Chinna Nadar for toy pistols.  The “toy pistols \nare toy pistols” plea of Mr Vaidyanathan is really, therefore, \nirrelevant.  Chinna Nadar’s registration was for amorces.  Toy pistols \nwhich spray water cannot, howsoever much the imagination were to \nbe strained, be likened to amorces.  Indeed, one would extinguish the \nother.   \n \n19. \nThis is not an infringement suit.  We are concerned, therefore, \nnot with Section 29, but with Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act.  \nRefusal of an application for registration is justified only if the \ngrounds are relatable either to Section 9 or to Section 11.  Section \n11(1), as already noted, envisages refusal of registration only if, either \n(i) \n(a) \nthe applicant’s mark and the earlier mark are \nidentical and the marks are used for similar goods or \nservices, or \n \n(b) \nthe applicant’s mark and the earlier mark are \nsimilar, and the marks are used for identical or similar \ngoods or services, and \n(ii) \nregistration of the applicant’s mark would result in a a \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 10 of 13 \n \nlikelihood of confusion, or association with the earlier mark, on \nthe part of the public. \n“Likelihood of confusion” is not to be easily presumed.  The nature of \nthe goods and the class of their purchasers has to be borne in mind.   \n \n20. \nThe appellant’s COCK word mark and Chinna Nadar’s COCK \ndevice mark cannot, strictly speaking, be said to be identical.  That \napart, mere identity or similarity of the marks is not sufficient to \ndisentitle an applicant for registration under Section 11(1).  It has, \nadditionally, to be shown that \n(i) \nthe goods or services in respect of which the earlier mark \nstood registered or applied for, were identical or similar to the \ngoods or services in respect of which registration was being \nsought, and \n(ii) \nregistration of the mark in favour of the applicant would \nresult in a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. \n \n21. \nRegistration of an “eligible” mark is a valuable commercial \nright.  Registration brings, in its fold, several inalienable entitlements; \nmost importantly the entitlement to protection against infringement.  \nRegistration, where the mark is eligible therefor cannot, therefore, be \nrefused.  An application for registration of a trade mark, therefore, can \nbe rejected only if it falls strictly within the peripheries of the criteria \nenvisaged by Sections 9 and 11 of the Trademarks Act. \n \n22. \nViewed thus, for the following reasons, I am of the opinion that \nthe appellant’s mark would be entitled to registration: \n \n(i) \nThe appellant’s mark cannot be treated as identical or \nsimilar to the mark which already stood registered in favour of \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 11 of 13 \n \nChinna Nadar.  The appellant sought registration of the word \nmark COCK.  The mark registered in favour of Mr. A.S. Chinna \nNadar was the \n device mark, which contained, \nprominently, the words “COCK BRAND” above the figure of a \nstrutting cock and, below that, the word “AMORCES”.  A \nperson viewing the mark would, therefore, be made clearly \naware of the fact that the mark was used only in respect of \namorces and nothing else.  There could not, therefore, be said \nthat there existed any likelihood of confusion, much less a \npossibility of Chinna Nadar’s goods being passed off as a goods \nof the appellant by reason of the registration of the appellant’s \nmark. \n \n(ii) \nThat apart, amorces and toy spray guns used for spraying \nwater and colours are neither identical or similar.  Chinna \nNadar’s COCK brand was registered only for amorces; not even \nfor toy guns.  Amorces are not used with spray guns which \nspray water or colour; indeed, water would extinguish the \namorce and render it unusable.  Amorces are fireworks.  The \nappellant’s guns spray coloured water.  Fire cannot be likened \nto water.  The appellant sought registration of the word mark \nCOCK for toy pistols or guns used for spraying coloured water \nduring festivals.  They have nothing in common with toy pistols \nused in fireworks; much less with amorces used with such \npistols.  The mere fact that, in some festivals, both may be used, \nis irrelevant.  Similarity, for the purposes of Section 11(1), has \nto be of the goods or services, not of the occasion of their user.    \nThe impugned order of the learned Senior Examiner has not \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 12 of 13 \n \nconsidered this aspect or the difference in the nature of the \ngoods for which the appellant sought registration, vis-à-vis the \ngoods for which the COCK mark was registered in favour of \nChinna Nadar.   \n \n(iii) Further, there is little chance of any likelihood of \nconfusion in the minds of public between the two marks, or \nlikelihood of any association, by registration of the COCK word \nmark in favour of the appellant, with the rgistratioon of the \n device mark in favour of Chinna Nadar.  As already \nnoted, the appellant’s mark was being used in toy pistols which \nsprayed coloured water during festivals.  The \n device \nmark registered in favour of Chinna Nadar was, on the other \nhand, used for amorces, which are in the nature of small \nfireworks.  It cannot, therefore, be said, in the absence of any \nmaterial to indicate to the contrary, that the registration of the \nCOCK word mark in favour of the appellant, as sought, would \nresult in any likelihood of confusion in the minds of the public. \n \n23. \nNone of the three criteria, which require cumulative satisfaction \nin order for an application for registration of a mark to be rejected \nunder Section 11(1) of the Trademarks Act can, therefore, be said to \nbe satisfied in the present case. \n \n24. \nIn that view of the matter, it is not necessary for this Court to \nenter into the allegations of mala fide etc. which find place in the \nimpugned order and which, in my opinion, ought not to have been \nDigitally Signed\nBy:KAMLA RAWAT\nSigning Date:02.02.2023\n17:45:24\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000729 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 143/2021  \nPage 13 of 13 \n \nreturned without adequate evidence. \n \nConclusion \n \n25. \nFor the aforesaid reasons, I am unable to sustain the impugned \norder, which is accordingly quashed and set aside.

An “amorce”, as Mr. Miglani \npoints out from the dictionary, is a percussion cap for a toy pistol. \nElsewhere, the expression “amorce” is defined as “a firework which is \na percussion cap designed for use in toys, which comprises of paper \nenvelope containing a dot of impact sensitive pyrotechnic composition \nand which forms part of a roll”. \n \n7. \nI may note, here, that, in India, such rolls, which are fitted in toy \npistols, are often used by children on the occasion of festivals such as \nDiwali. These rolls are often mounted on pistols between the striking \nsurface and the body of the pistol so that, when the pistol is cocked \nand fired, due to the impact of the strike, a small spark is emitted with \na noise imitative of a bullet being fired.

In view of these \ngrounds, the Tribunal has opined that the applicant has deliberately \nchosen the subject mark in an effort to ride upon the goodwill and \nreputation of the conflicting marks.

Allowance of the subject mark is \nadversely affecting the interest of the public; it would lead to \nconfusion as it is more than likely, due to imperfect recollection \nthat the average buyer may confuse the applicant’s mark “COCK” \nas the conflicting owner’s product sold under “COCK”. In view of \nsuch similarities between the nature of the marks and their goods, \nthe applicant’s trade channel and counters, there exists a strong \nlikelihood of confusions on the part of the consuming public, \nincluding an association, as they are likely to assume and confuse \nthat the applicant’s goods are connected or otherwise associated \nwith the conflicting marks goods, when no such connection exists. \nConsequently, the members of the trade would no doubt, be under \nthe mistaken belief that the applicant’s goods originate from the \nconflicting mark or that they have some trade connection or \naffiliation thereby causing irreparable loss and damage not only to \nthe conflicting mark trade and business but also suiting erosion of \ndistinctiveness hard earned by the conflicting marks. \n \nIn addition to the facts of the subject application, I want to \ndiscuss the land mark case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. v.

Registrar of Trade Marks (2023/DHC/000729)\n\n**Background:** The appellants sought registration for the \"COCK\" brand, used for water and color pistols, guns, and sprayers, under Class 28. The respondents (Registrar of Trade Marks) refused registration citing a trademark owned by A.S. Chinna Nadar.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n* The COCK brand was registered in favor of Manu Garg and Ratan Behari Aggarwal since 1992 for use in Holi colors.\n* In February 2018, Kaliswari Fireworks (owned by Chinna Nadar) objected to the use of their \"COCK\" mark for water and color pistols. However, on being informed about Garg's COCK brand registration, they expressed satisfaction with Garg's reply.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* Appellants' counsel (M.K. Miglani) argued that Chinna Nadar's goods were completely different from their Holi colors.\n* Respondents' counsel (Harish Vaidyanathan) disputed this claim, citing the similarity in use of \"COCK\" mark for toy pistols.\n\n**Decision:** The Senior Examiner rejected registration, considering the likelihood of confusion between Garg's and Chinna Nadar's \"COCK\" marks. This decision is being challenged by the appellants (Garg).\n\n**Key dates:**\n\n* 1992: Registration of COCK brand in favor of Manu Garg and Ratan Behari Aggarwal\n* February 2018: Kaliswari Fireworks objects to use of their \"COCK\" mark for water and color pistols\n\n**Legal references:**\n\n* Trade Marks Act, Section 11 (relative grounds for refusal of registration)\n* Trade Marks Act, Section 12 (special provisions)",

Mr Vaidyanathan’s submission that toy \npistols are toy pistols, I feel, oversimplifies the issue.

A gun which sprays water and a gun \nwhich emits a spark and, therefore, releases heat and light are about as \nalike as chalk and cheese.
