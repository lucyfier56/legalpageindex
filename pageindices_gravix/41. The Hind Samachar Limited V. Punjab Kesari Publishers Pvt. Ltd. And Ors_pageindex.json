    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: The Hind Samachar Limited vs Punjab Kesari Publishers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.**\n\n**Background:**\nThe case involves a dispute between two family members of the VKC group (comprising of defendants 1 to 12) over the ownership and use of the trade mark \"PUNJAB KESARI\". The plaintiff, The Hind Samachar Limited, sought rectification of the registration of the trade mark maintained by the Registrar of Trademarks by cancelling the registration granted to Respondent 1 (one of the defendants), who claims exclusive rights over the trade mark.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n1. **Rectification of Trade Mark Registration**: The plaintiff sought cancellation of the registration of the trade mark under Sections 47 and 57 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\n2. **Conflict over Trade Mark Ownership**: The dispute revolves around the ownership of the trade mark \"PUNJAB KESARI\" between two family members.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\nFor the plaintiff (The Hind Samachar Limited):\n* argued that Respondent 1 (one of the defendants) had obtained registration of the trade mark through fraudulent and deceitful means\n* requested rectification of the registration to protect their rights and prevent further misuse\n\nFor the Respondent (Punjab Kesari Publishers Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.):\n* argued that they have used the trade mark for over 2 decades without any opposition or objection from the plaintiff\n* produced a Memorandum of Family Settlement, dated July 16, 2022, which demarcates territories for use of the subject mark between the VKC group and AKC group (comprising the defendants)\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\n1. **Memorandum of Family Settlement**: The Court considered the Memorandum of Family Settlement produced by the Respondent, dated July 16, 2022.\n2. **Rectification of Trade Mark Registration**: Upon perusal of the record and after considering submissions from both parties, the Court noted that there is no evidence to suggest fraud or deceit on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n**Decision:**\nIn view of the Memorandum of Family Settlement and considering the lack of evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim of fraudulent registration, the Court was inclined to dispose of the case in terms of the settlement. The Court further directed rectification of the Register of Trade Marks by restricting the trade mark \"PUNJAB KESARI\" registered under Trademark No. 3353424 dated September 2, 2016 in favor of Respondent 1 (one of the defendants) for specific territories as demarcated in the Memorandum of Family Settlement.\n\n**Outcome:**\nThe Court ultimately allowed IA 21222/2022 and disposed of CO (COMM.IPD-TM) 285/2021 by directing rectification of the Register of Trade Marks according to the terms of the Memorandum of Family Settlement.",
