    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary:**\n\nThis is a trademark registration case filed by Lite Bite Travel Foods Private Limited (Appellant) against the Registrar of Trademarks (Respondent). The Appellant sought registration for its device mark \"Oasis Lounge By Lite Bite Travel Foods\" on 28th August 2018.\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe Examiner in the office of the Registry of Trade Marks, vide his First Examination Report (FER), dated 29th September 2018, opined that the application was open to objection on relative grounds of refusal under Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act. The FER enclosed details of earlier existing trademarks that were similar or identical.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\nThe main legal issue in this case revolved around the likelihood of confusion between the Appellant's proposed mark and the earlier registered marks. Specifically, whether the marks \"OASIS Lounge By Lite Bite Travel Foods\" and \"OASIS\" (registered by Capsulation Services Pvt. Ltd.) would cause confusion among consumers.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\nThe Appellant argued that its mark as a whole is different, and it has evidence of use subsequent to the date of application, making it eligible for registration.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nThe learned Deputy Registrar (Deputy Examiner) of Trade Marks, after hearing arguments from both parties, upheld the objection raised under Section 11(1) of the Trade Marks Act. The Deputy Registrar examined:\n\n1.  The leading/dominant feature of the applied mark is \"OASIS,\" which is common and similar to TM Nos. 2045465 and 3131397.\n2.  Services provided by both marks are similar, making it more probable for confusion among consumers.\n3.  Although the Appellant argued that its evidence of use supports its claim, this evidence cannot be considered at this stage.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on these findings, the Deputy Registrar decided not to accept the application (No. 3928838) and refused registration stating, \"given marks are remembered by broad expression, to my mind, there is likelihood of confusion between applied mark & citation conflicting marks\".\n\nIn brief, after perusal of records and submission made by applicant/authorised agent it was concluded that the proposed trade mark was not registrable mainly because of similarity with previous existing marks for similar services.",

A user affidavit of Mr. Sukhpreet Singh, an authorised \nrepresentative of the appellant, was also filed with the said reply, \nto vouchsage this contention. The affidavit annexed documents \nshowing use of the \n trade mark, under which \nmark, the appellant was running an outlet at the Mumbai \nInternational \nAirport. \nPlacards, \nsignboards \nand \nother \nrepresentations available at the airport, as well as the illuminated \nsignage outside the appellant’s premises at the airport, were also \nannexed.  \n \n(ii) \nAs such, the general public was well aware of the \nappelalnt’s \noutlet \nand \ninvaribly \nassociated \nthe \nmark with the serivces provided by the appellant. \n \n(iii) \nThe \n mark relatable to Application No. 3131397 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:23.01.2023\n17:07:48\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000482 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 4/2021 \n \nPage 5 of 9 \n \nof M/s Goel Fashions Pvt. Ltd. was not registered, as it was \nunder objections.  This, therefore, could not constitute an “earlier \ntrade mark”  for the purposes of Section 11 (1)(d) of the Trade \nMarks Act.  \n(iv) \nInsofar as the \n mark of M/s Capsulation Services \nPvt. Ltd. (“Capsulation Services”) was concerned, the appellant \nclaimed to be a bona fide adopter and user of the \n \ntrade mark, who, by virtue of the extensive usage of the said \nmark, had earned its own reputation and goodwill and made a \nplace for itself in the hospitality market.  \n \n(v) \nThe services provided by the appellant, under the \nmark were different from the services provided \nby capsulation services under the \n mark. \n \n(vi) \nThere was, therefore, no likelihood of confusion, if any, \nbetween \n mark of the appellant and the \n \nmark of Capsulation Services, resulting in any confusion in the \nmind of the public, with respect to the entity with which the mark \nwas associated or the services provided thereunder. \n \n(vii) \nThe marks, seen as a whole, were clearly distinguishable. \nThe appellant’s mark was \n whereas the mark of  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:23.01.2023\n17:07:48\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000482 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 4/2021 \n \nPage 6 of 9 \n \nCapsulation Services,  was \n. Besides, the marks were \nvisually completely distintinct and constituted disntinct artistic \nrepresentations.  \n \n(viii) \nThe appellant had never been communicated any \nobjection or any other communication by anyone who claimed to \nhave been confused as result of the adoption, by the appellant, of \nthe  \n mark, for the registration of which the \napplication had been filed.  \n \n \n8. \nI have heard Mr. Manish Dhir, learned Counsel for the appellant \nand Mr. Srish Kumar Mishra, learned Counsel for the respondent at \nsome length. \n \n9. \nPlainly, the impugned order does not consider the various \ngrounds urged by the appellant in its reply dated 11th February 2020 to \nthe FER dated 29th September 2018. There is, equally, no reflection of \nany consideration of the affidavit of Mr. Sukhpreet Singh or the \nmaterial that was filed therewith.  \n \n10. \nIn fact, the learned Deputy Registrar has, it appears, proceeded \non a complete misreading of Section 11(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act.  \nThe impugned order reflects the view that mere similarity of the \nmarks, of which registration is sought, is, by itself, sufficient as a \nground to reject the application seeking registration. That, however, is \nnot the position as it obtains in law. Even statutorily, Section 11(1)((b) \nis subject to two other provisions/caveats.  \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:23.01.2023\n17:07:48\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000482 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 4/2021 \n \nPage 7 of 9 \n \n11. \nSection 11(1) starts with the words “save as provided in Section \n12”. Section 12, therefore, operates as an exception to Section 11(1).  \nSection 12 deals with entitlement to registration where, despite \nsimilarity of the marks, the applicant pleads honest and concurrent \nuser. In the present case, the appellant has specifically pleaded honest \nand concurrent user. There is no reflection of any application of mind \nby the learned Registrar of Trademarks to the said contention. \n \n12. \nAdditionally, similarity of the mark, of which registration is \nsought, coupled with identity or similarity of the goods or services \ncovered by the said mark can constitute a basis for rejection of an \napplication seeking registration of the mark, under Section 11(1)(b) \nonly where, because of such similarity between the marks and identity \nand similarity of goods or services covered by the marks, there exists \na likelihood of confusion on the part of the public or of the public \nassociating the mark, of which registration is sought, with the earlier \ntrade mark. \n \n13. \nThe existence, or otherwise, of likelihood of confusion is an \nissue of fact. Until and unless, on facts, it is established that, owing to \nidentity/similarity of the mark of which registration is sought, and of \nthe goods/services covered thereby, with an earlier mark, there is \nlikelihood of confusion/association in the mind of the public, \nregistration cannot be refused on that ground.  \n \n14. \nIn the event that Section 11(1)(b) is stated as a ground for \nrejection of an application seeking registration of a mark, therefore, \nthe impugned order must additionally contain a finding that, owing to \nsimilarity of the mark of which registration is sought with an earlier \ntrade mark and identity/similarity of the goods and services covered \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:23.01.2023\n17:07:48\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000482 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 4/2021 \n \nPage 8 of 9 \n \nby \nthe \nsaid \nmark, \nthere \nis \na \npositive \nlikelihood \nof \nconfusion/association, on the part of the public, as envisaged by the \nprovision.  Such a finding can be returned only after examining the \nfacts and the material on record.  It cannot merely be chanted as a \nmantra. \n \n15. \nThe appellant has raised several contentions in its reply dated \n11th February 2020 to the FER dated 29th September 2018. \nAdditionally, an affidavit of Mr. Sukhpreet Singh, along with material \nsubstantiating the contentions raised in the reply, was also filed, and \nthe impugned order does not reflect any examination or consideration \nof the submissions contained in the reply dated 11th February 2020, \nthe affidavit of Mr. Sukhpreet Singh or the documents filed with the \naffidavit, I deem it appropriate that the matter be remanded to the \nlearned Registrar of Trademarks for re-consideration.  \n \nConclusion \n \n16. \nResultantly, the impugned order dated 7th January 2021 is \nquashed and set aside. The Application no. 3928838 dated 28th August \n2018 filed by the appellant for registration of the \nmark \nis remanded for re-consideration, from the stage of submission, by the \nappellant, of its reply dated 11th February 2020 to the FER dated 29th \nSeptember 2018 of the Examiner. \n \n17. \nThe appellant would be entitled to an opportunity of personal \nhearing before a decision is taken.

State (CBI/SPE)1, the learned Registrar is \nrequested to assign the task of adjudication to an officer other than the \nofficer who has passed the impugned order dated 7th January 2021.  \n \n19. \nIt is made clear that this direction is not intended to cast any \naspersion on the learned Deputy Registrar who passed the impugned \norder and is only intended to assuage any apprehension, in the minds \nof the appellant, that the officer has already pre-determined the issue. \n \n20. \nThe appeal stands allowed accordingly, with no order as to \ncosts. \n \nC.
