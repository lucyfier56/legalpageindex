Ashirvad Pipes Pvt Ltd**\n\n**High Court of Delhi at New Delhi**\n\n**Judgment Delivered on February 23, 2023**\n\nIn this case, Astral Ltd (Plaintiff) sought an interim injunction against Ashirvad Pipes Pvt Ltd (Defendant) to prevent the use of the trademark \"CPVC FLOWPRO\" which was allegedly similar to the Plaintiff's registered trademark \"CPVC PRO\".\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe Plaintiff is a well-established company engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling pipes, parts, and fittings for various purposes. The Company has been using the trademark \"CPVC PRO\" since 2016 and has obtained various registrations for this mark. In contrast, the Defendant's application to register the mark \"CPVC FLOWPRO\" was filed in January 2021 on a proposed-to-be-used basis.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\nThe main legal issue involved in this case is whether the use of the trademark \"CPVC FLOWPRO\" by the Defendant amounts to passing off or an infringement of the Plaintiff's registered trademark \"CPVC PRO\".\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n*   The Plaintiff argued that the trademark \"CPVC FLOWPRO\" was an attempt by the Defendant to ride on the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff, and as such, it was a case of passing off.\n*   The Plaintiff claimed that it had been using the mark \"CPVC PRO\" since 2016, whereas the Defendant's application for registration was filed in January 2021.\n*   The Plaintiff relied on precedents to argue that the use of a similar mark by another company could cause confusion among consumers and dilute the reputation of the original mark.\n*   The Defendant argued that there was no similarity between the two marks, as the word \"FLOWPRO\" was not present in the Plaintiff's registered trademark.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nAfter considering the pleadings, written submissions, and arguments of both sides, the Court held that:\n\n*   There was prima facie case made out by the Plaintiff for interim injunction.\n*   The balance of convenience lay in favour of granting interim injunction.\n*   Irreparable injury would be caused to the Plaintiff if the Defendant was allowed to use the mark \"CPVC FLOWPRO\".\n*   It was necessary to protect the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the above findings, the Court granted an **interim injunction** in favour of the Plaintiff, restraining the Defendant from using or adopting the trademark \"CPVC FLOWPRO\" until further orders.",

Both the sides have filed their respective \nbrief notes of submissions. \nCASE SET UP IN THE PLAINT \n3. \nThe case set up in the plaint is as under: \n3.1 \nPlaintiff company was incorporated on 25th March, 1996 as a private \nlimited company and in the year 2006, the plaintiff company was \nconverted into a public limited company.   \n3.2 \nPlaintiff company is engaged in the business of manufacturing, \ndistributing and selling of high-quality pipes, parts and fittings for use \nin plumbing, sewage, drainage, fire protection and the like. The \nplaintiff company has manufacturing facilities at six locations in India \nand has received various awards and accolades in respect of its \nvarious products. \n3.3 \nIn the year 2004, the plaintiff company became the first entity to \nlaunch Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) piping systems in \nIndia.  \n3.4 \nThe plaintiff has filed and obtained various registrations in respect of \nthe mark ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC PRO’ formative trademarks, \nwhich are detailed in paragraph 15 of the plaint. \n3.5 \nSome of the registrations of the plaintiff have a disclaimer that no \nexclusive rights have been granted in respect of the words ‘CPVC \nPRO’ and ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’.  However, the subsequent \nregistrations do not have this condition.  Some of the applications \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 3 of 18 \n \nfiled on behalf of the plaintiff in respect of ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC \nPRO’ formative marks have been objected to. \n3.6 \nPlaintiff has engaged various celebrities and superstars from time to \ntime to advertise their products under the aforesaid trademarks. \n3.7 \nThe statement in respect of domestic sales and exports of the plaintiff \nhave been provided in paragraph 20 of the plaint.  In the year 2021–\n2022, the sales of the plaintiff in respect of the trademarks ‘CPVC \nPRO’ was around Rs.954 crores. \n3.8 \nOn account of its superior quality, continuous and extensive use, and \nlarge scale publicity, the plaintiff’s trademark ‘CPVC PRO’ has \nacquired immense reputation and goodwill in the market.  \nAccordingly, the plaintiff claims both statutory as well as common \nlaw rights in the trademark ‘CPVC PRO’. \n3.9 \nDefendant has also filed various trademark applications in respect of \nsimilar products which are pending as on date.  The  grievance of the \nplaintiff is with regard to the impugned mark ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’, \nwherein ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ are being used together and the same is \nsimilar to the trademark of the plaintiff, ‘CPVC PRO’. \n3.10 The trademark application of the defendant was filed in January, \n2021, on a „proposed to be used basis‟, whereas the plaintiff has been \nusing the ‘CPVC PRO’ marks since 2016.  In this  regard, invoices \nhave been placed on record by the plaintiff.   \n3.11 The adoption of the trademark ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’ by the defendant \nis dishonest and an attempt to ride on the goodwill and reputation of \nthe plaintiff. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 4 of 18 \n \n3.12 A cease and desist notice dated 17th December, 2021 was issued by \nthe plaintiff to the defendant.  The aforesaid notice was replied to by \nthe defendant. \n3.13 Accordingly, the present suit was filed seeking a decree of permanent \ninjunction along with other ancillary reliefs. \nCASE SET UP IN THE WRITTEN STATEMENT \n4. \nThe case set out in the written statement is as under: \n4.1 \nThe plaintiff does not have any grievance with the use of the word \n‘CPVC’ by the defendant as it is an abbreviation of the material of the \nplastic.  The plaintiff objects to the use of the word ‘PRO’, which \ncannot be monopolized by the plaintiff.  Reliance is placed on the \nvarious dictionary meanings of the word ‘PRO’, which show that the \nword ‘PRO’ is a generic, descriptive and laudatory word.  The word \n‘PRO’ is used by several well-known companies  in relation to \ndifferent products as part of their marks, details of which are given in \nparagraph 14 of the written statement. \n4.2 \nIn several of the registrations granted in favour of the plaintiff, a \ncondition has been imposed on the plaintiff that the plaintiff shall not \nhave exclusive right over the marks/terms ‘CPVC PRO’, ‘CPVC \nCHEM PRO’ and ‘CHEM PRO’.  Further, several of the plaintiff’s \nmarks were refused registration under Section 9 of the Trade Marks \nAct, 1999.  Therefore, the other registrations granted to the plaintiff in \nrespect of ‘CPVC PRO’ formative marks are bad in law and the \nplaintiff cannot rely upon them.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 5 of 18 \n \n4.3 \nThe trademark registrations in respect of word marks ‘CPVC PRO’ \nhave to be treated as suspended since it was obtained during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Reliance in this regard is placed on the \njudgment dated 21st March, 2022 passed by this Court in WP(C)-IPD \nNo.4/2022 titled Dr. Reddy Laboratories Limited v. Controller \nGeneral of Patents Designs and Trademarks. \n4.4 \n The plaintiff has always used the words ‘CPVC PRO’ in conjunction \nwith its house mark ‘ASTRAL’ and has never used the same \nindependently. \nTherefore, \nthe \nplaintiff \ncannot \nclaim \nany \ndistinctiveness in respect of the mark ‘CPVC PRO’.  \n4.5 \nThe defendant has been selling its products under the trademark \n since the year 1975.  Details of turnover of the \ndefendant are given on page 44, paragraph 11 of the written \nstatement.  In the year 2021, the defendant had a revenue of around \nRs.3,500 crores. \n4.6 \nDefendant has been selling and exporting products under the mark \n since November, 2021. \n4.7 \nThe \nmark/expression \n‘ASHIRVAD \nBY \nALIAXIS \nCPVC \nFLOWPRO’ is dissimilar to the mark/expression used by the plaintiff \nand therefore, there cannot be any cause for confusion.  Both the \nplaintiff and the defendant use their house marks ‘ASTRAL’ and \n‘ASHIRVAD’ respectively in conjunction with the words ‘CPVC’, \n‘PRO’ and/or ‘CPVC PRO’. \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 6 of 18 \n \nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF \n5. \nSupplementing the averments made in the plaint, counsel for the \nplaintiff made the following submissions: \n5.1 \nIn view of the fact that the plaintiff has obtained subsequent \nregistrations without any disclaimer, the conditions imposed while \ngranting earlier registrations are not relevant and the present suit for \ninfringement and passing off is maintainable. \n5.2 \nThe adoption of the mark ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’ by the defendant is \ndishonest as the words ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’ are the most prominent \nwords used on their pipes and fittings. The defendant is already selling \nCPVC pipes under the trademark ‘ASHIRVAD FLOW GUARD’ in \nterms of the license agreement entered into by the plaintiff with \nLubrizol. \n5.3 \nA party can be given proprietary rights even in respect of laudatory \nand dictionary words. In view of the fact that the defendant has also \napplied for registration in respect of the words ‘CPVC PRO’, the \ndefendant cannot claim that the said mark is generic. \n5.4 \nNo one in the market is using the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ or the word \n‘PRO’ in respect of pipes and fittings.   \nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT \n6. \nIn support of the averments made in the written statement, senior  \ncounsel appearing on behalf of the defendant has  made the following \nsubmissions: \n6.1 \nEven though in respect of four of the plaintiff’s registrations, there is a \ndisclaimer in respect of the word ‘CPVC PRO’, the plaintiff has \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 7 of 18 \n \ndeliberately filed applications in various Classes in respect of the \ntrademark ‘CPVC PRO’ so that some of the registrations are granted \nwithout any disclaimers. \n6.2 \nDescriptive and generic marks such as ‘CPVC’ and/or ‘PRO’ cannot \nbe monopolized by a party on the ground that they are the first user \nthereof. \n6.3 \nWithout prejudice to the contention of the defendant that the word \n‘PRO’ is laudatory and cannot be monopolized, the defendant is not \nusing the word ‘PRO’ on a stand-alone basis.  The defendant is using \nthe term ‘FLOWPRO’ in conjunction with ‘CPVC’. \n6.4 \nThe pipes and fixtures in the market are known by the respective \nbrands, which in the present case is ‘ASTRAL’ in respect of the \nplaintiff and ‘ASHIRVAD’ in respect of the defendant.  Both the \naforesaid brands are distinctive and appear prominently on the \nproducts of the parties. There cannot be any question of passing off as \nproducts of both plaintiff and defendant are sold with their house \nmarks. \n6.5 \nEvidence of subsequent use of the mark post registration cannot be \nlooked into in an infringement action. \n6.6 \nWhether or not the marks ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ have acquired \ndistinctiveness is a matter of trial. \n7. \nI have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the record.  \nANALYSIS AND FINDINGS \n8. \nAt the outset, reference may be made to the competing marks of the \nparties, which are reproduced hereinbelow: \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 8 of 18 \n \n \n \n \nPLAINTIFF’S MARKS \nDEFENDANT’S MARK \n \n \n \n \n9. \nA perusal of the above would show that the defendant is using the \nwords ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ along with its house mark ‘ASHIRVAD’/ \n‘ASHIRVAD BY ALIAXIS’ even though the house mark is written in a \nslightly smaller font. In the first instance, the plaintiff is using the words \n‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ along with its house mark ‘ASTRAL’. In the second \ninstance, the plaintiff is using ‘CPVC PRO’ without its house mark \n‘ASTRAL’. Where the term ‘ASTRAL’ is used by the plaintiff in \nconjunction with ‘CPVC PRO’, the usage of the distinctive house marks of \nthe parties negate any possibility of deception or confusion in the marks. \nFurther, in both the aforesaid usages of the plaintiff, the word ‘CPVC’, in \nrespect of which the plaintiff does not claim exclusivity, is written in a much \nlarger font as compared to the other elements of the mark. In fact, the word \n‘PRO’, for which the plaintiff seeks exclusivity, has been written in a \nsmaller font in the plaintiff’s product, whereas in the defendant’s product, it \nis in the same font size as the word ‘CPVC’. Further, the word ‘PRO’ is not \nbeing used by itself but as a component of the term ‘FLOWPRO’ by the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 9 of 18 \n \ndefendant. Even the font and style of writing of ‘CPVC’ and ‘PRO’ in the \ncompeting marks are distinguishable. Therefore, in my prima facie view it \ncannot be said that there is a possibility of confusion or deception being \ncaused among the customers of the two products.  \n10. \nAt this stage, reference may be made to the various trademark \nregistrations granted to the plaintiff as set out in paragraph 15 of the plaint. \nS.NO. \nREGISTRATION \nNO. \nTRADEMARK \nDATE OF \nAPPLICATION \nCLASS \n1. \n3298112 \n \n30.06.2016 \n17 \n2. \n3298113 \n \n30.06.2016 \n17 \n3. \n3298114 \n \n30.06.2016 \n19 \n4. \n3298116 \n \n30.06.2016 \n17 \n5. \n3298117 \n \n30.06.2016 \n19 \n6. \n3298118 \n \n30.06.2016 \n17 \n7. \n3298119 \n \n30.06.2016 \n19 \n8. \n3298120 \n \n30.06.2016 \n9 \n9. \n3298121 \n \n30.06.2016 \n21 \n10. \n3298122 \n \n30.06.2016 \n19 \n11. \n3355646 \n \n06.09.2016 \n19 \n12. \n3355647 \n \n06.09.2016 \n17 \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 10 of 18 \n \n13. \n3355648 \n \n06.09.2016 \n19 \n14. \n3355650 \n \n06.09.2016 \n19 \n15. \n3355651 \n \n06.09.2016 \n9 \n16. \n4484822 \nCPVC PRO \n03.04.2020 \n17 \n17. \n4484823 \nCPVC PRO \n03.04.2020 \n9 \n11. \nA perusal of the table above would show that the registrations at serial \nno.1 to 10 are of various composite marks, which include the house mark of \nthe plaintiff, ‘ASTRAL’.

The registrations at serial no.1 to 3 and 12 \nabove have a condition that no exclusive rights have been given to the \nplaintiff over the terms ‘CPVC PRO’, ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’ and ‘CHEM \nPRO’. It is also be noted that the applications  at serial no. 11 to 15 in the \ntable above have been filed on a „proposed to be used basis‟, except serial \nno. 14, which has been filed with the claim of use of around one month.  \nFurthermore, a perusal of the registration granted in favour of the plaintiff at \nserial no. 14 would also show that the registration has been granted in \nrespect of the stylized manner of writing and not in respect of the words \n‘CPVC PRO’ either in conjunction with each other or individually.  \n12. \nIt is also relevant to note here that other applications filed by the \nplaintiff for the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC PRO’ formative marks, all \ndated 6th September, 2016, have been objected to by the Registry on the \nground that they lack distinctiveness.  Yet, the applications at serial no.11 to \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 11 of 18 \n \n15, in respect of similar trademarks, were accepted by the Registry.  Further, \nwhen conditions with regard to use of the term ‘CPVC PRO’ have been \nimposed on the earlier registrations of the plaintiff given at serial no.1 to 3 \nand 12 above, there is no explanation as to why similar conditions were not \nimposed by the Registry in respect of the trademark applications given at \nserial no.11, 13, 14 and 15 above. It appears that the plaintiff was randomly \nfiling registrations for marks with minor variations in several Classes, \nhoping that some of the registrations would be granted without any \nconditions. To illustrate, the plaintiff has been granted registration in respect \nof the mark \n in Class 19 without any disclaimer/condition on \nthe registration, whereas registration of the identical mark under TM \nApplication No.3355649 has been refused by the Registry in Class 17. This \nraises a serious doubt with regard to the validity of the registrations granted \nin favour of the plaintiff at serial no.11 to 15 in the table above. Therefore, \nat this interlocutory stage, the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly over the \nwords ‘CPVC’ or ‘PRO’ either individually or in conjunction with each \nother/other words and these registrations cannot be relied upon the plaintiff \nin the present suit for infringement. \n13. \nThe registrations at serial no.16 and 17 were in respect of ‘CPVC \nPRO’ word marks per se. The same were granted in 2020, during the \nCOVID-19 period, in the absence of any oppositions. In this regard, \nreference may be made to the judgment in Dr. Reddy Laboratories Limited \n(supra), wherein a Coordinate Bench of this Court has made the following \nobservations: \n“18. In any event, in terms of the orders of the Supreme Court \nextending the period of limitation in all proceedings and the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 12 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 12 of 18 \n \nstand of the CGPDTM before the Delhi High Court in W.P.(C) \n3059/2020, the CGPDTM has a duty to extend the limitation for \nfiling oppositions to trademark applications… \n \n(v) Insofar as trademark registration certificates which may \nhave been issued during the pandemic period, the \nregistration certificates shall be dealt with in the following \nmanner:  \n \n(a) In respect of the trademark applications in which no \noppositions have been already filed or are received till \n30th May, 2022, the said registration certificates shall \nremain valid and the said applicants shall enjoy their \nstatutory rights in accordance with law.  \n \n(b) In respect of those trademark applications where \noppositions have already been filed or are filed by 30th \nMay, 2022, the registration certificates shall either not \nbe issued or if already issued, the same shall stand \nsuspended till the oppositions are decided by the office \nof the CGPDTM.” \n14. \nIn light of the aforesaid judgment, since the defendant had filed \noppositions before 30th May, 2022, the registrations granted in favour of the \nplaintiff and provided at serial no.16 and 17 in the table above would stand \nsuspended until the oppositions are decided. Therefore, no reliance can be \nplaced on the registrations of the word mark ‘CPVC PRO’.  \n15. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has further submitted that the plaintiff has no \nobjection to the defendant using the word ‘CPVC’ as it is an abbreviation for \na material of the plastic. However, an objection is raised with regard to the \nuse of the word ‘PRO’ in conjunction with the word ‘CPVC’ as the plaintiff \nclaims that the word ‘CPVC FLOWPRO’ is deceptively similar to the mark \nused by the plaintiff, ‘CPVC PRO’. It is a settled position of law that \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 13 of 18 \n \ngeneric, laudatory and descriptive marks cannot be monopolized by anyone \nunless a case is made out in respect of the mark acquiring distinctive \ncharacter or of its well-known status. The fact that conditions were imposed \non the plaintiff by the Registry, against the use of generic terms like ‘CPVC \nPRO’ and ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’, is clearly indicative of the fact that the \nplaintiff cannot monopolize the terms ‘CPVC’ or ‘PRO’, individually or in \nconjunction with each other. \n16. \nTo show that the word ‘PRO’ is generic and laudatory, the counsel for \nthe defendant has submitted dictionary meanings of the said word, which are \nas under: \n“Cambridge Dictionary: The word „PRO‟ means: \n \n(a) „a professional or somebody who is better than others at \ndoing something; \n \n(b) „a person who receives money for playing a sport‟; \n \nOxford Dictionary: The word PRO means: \n \n„a person who works as a professional, especially in a sport‟.” \n \n17. \nIn support of their submission that the word ‘PRO’ is commonly used \nin the trade, the defendant has also placed material on record to show that \nvarious companies are selling pipes and other products in the construction \nindustry using the word ‘PRO’. Counsel for the plaintiff has disputed this \nsubmission and stated that no other pipes with the word mark ‘PRO’ are \navailable in the market. Be that as it may, this aspect can only be established \nin the trial and at a prima facie stage, the Court would have to take \ncognizance of the material placed on record by the defendant. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 14 of 18 \n \n18. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on my judgment in \nSoothe Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. Dabur India Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine \nDel  645. In the said case, the plaintiff sought an interim injunction against \nthe defendant on the ground that the trademark of the defendant ‘SUPER \nPANTS’ was deceptively similar to the trademark of the plaintiff ‘SUPER \nCUTES’ and ‘SUPER CUTESTERS’. Relying upon the judgment of a \nDivision Bench of this Court in Marico Limited v. Agro Tech Food \nLimited, 2010 (44) PTC 736 (Del) DB, the application for interim injunction \nwas dismissed. It was held, inter alia, that since the word ‘SUPER’ is being \nused in a laudatory manner, it is devoid of any distinctive character and \nincapable of distinguishing the goods of the plaintiff from that of others, and \ntherefore, even if the plaintiff had obtained registration in respect of the \nmark ‘SUPER’, it would not give the plaintiff exclusive right to use the \nmark ‘SUPER’. It was further noted that the fact that the house mark is \nwritten in a slightly smaller font would not make a material difference. One \nof the other grounds for denying injunction was that the defendant in the \nsaid case was using the mark ‘SUPER PANTS’ along with its house mark \n‘Dabur’. The relevant observations of the said judgment are set out below: \n“8. \nA comparison of the packaging of the defendant and the \nplaintiff above shows that other than the word “SUPER” \noccurring in both the aforesaid packaging, there is no other \nsimilarity. The packaging of the defendant includes the trade \nmark of the defendant, “Dabur” which is prominently \ndisplayed. Merely because the word “Dabur” is written in a \nslightly smaller font as compared to “SUPER PANTS”, in my \nopinion, would not make any difference. The fact of the matter \nis that the word “Dabur” is prominently displayed on the \npackaging along with the word “baby”. The colour scheme of \nthe packaging is also totally different. The colour scheme of the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 15 of 18 \n \nplaintiff is yellow and orange/blue and yellow, and the \ndefendant is primarily green. From the description of the \npackaging of the defendant's product, it is more than clear that \nthere is enough added material therein to distinguish the \ndefendant's product from that of the plaintiff. Therefore, it \ncannot be said that there is a possibility of confusion or \ndeception being caused among the customers of the two \nproducts. Hence, I am not convinced that the defendant is \npassing off their goods as those of the plaintiff. \n \n9. \nThe next issue that comes up for consideration is \nwhether word “SUPER” is a descriptive or a laudatory word \nand whether it can attain distinctiveness in respect of the \ngoods of the plaintiff. As per the Oxford's Learners \nDictionary, the word “SUPER” means “extremely good”, and \nas per the Cambridge Dictionary also, the word “SUPER” \nmeans “excellent or extremely good”. Clearly, as per its \ndictionary meaning, the word “super; is a laudatory word of \nthe English Language. \n \nXXX \n \n \n \nXXX  \n \n \n \nXXX \n \n13. \nIn view of the above, I am of the opinion that the mark \n“SUPER” is devoid of any distinctive character and not \ncapable of distinguishing the goods of the plaintiff. Therefore, \neven if the plaintiff has obtained registration in respect of the \nmarks “SUPER CUTESTERS”, “SUPER CUTES” and \n“SUPER CUTEZ”, it would not give him exclusive right over \nthe use of the word “SUPER”.” \n \n19. \nThe appeal filed against the aforesaid judgment was dismissed by the \njudgment of a Division Bench of this Court, reported as Soothe Healthcare \nPrivate Limited v. Dabur India Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2006. The \nrelevant observations of the Division Bench are set out below: \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 16 of 18 \n \n“37.  \nThe judgments relied upon are not applicable to the facts \nof the present case. There is no quarrel to the proposition that \neven an ordinary word or a descriptive word, if acquires a \nsecondary meaning and has acquired a distinctive character, can \nbe protected by way of an injunction when identified with a \nparticular product or being from a particular source. As \ndiscussed above, DABUR's mark, i.e., “DABUR BABY SUPER \nPANTS” when taken as a whole cannot be termed as deceptively \nsimilar to SOOTHE's registered marks referred in „paragraph 2‟ \nabove. As far as the use of the word “SUPER” by DABUR in its \nmark, the same, prima facie seems to be laudatory and \ndescriptive of the product being offered by DABUR. \nIndisputably, the term “SUPER” is widely used in respect of \nvarious products not only of similar nature but also of different \nclass and categories. SOOTHE cannot, therefore, prima \nfacie claim that the use of the word “SUPER” by DABUR in its \nmark is deceptively similar to SOOTHE's registered trademark \nfor the reason that the word “SUPER” also appears in \nSOOTHE's marks referred in „paragraph 2‟ above. SOOTHE \nalso cannot prima facie claim that the word “SUPER” \nappearing in its registered mark has acquired a secondary \nmeaning or a distinctive character when used in a particular \nproduct of SOOTHE, i.e., diapers.” \n \n20. \nThe present case is covered on all fours by the aforesaid judgments. \nThe word ‘PRO’, of which exclusive use was sought by the plaintiff, is \nsimilar to the word ‘SUPER’ as both are laudatory words. Prima facie, the \nword ‘PRO’, either by itself or in conjunction with the word ‘CPVC’, \nappears to be non-distinctive and laudatory in terms of Section 9 of the \nTrade Marks Act, 1999. Even if the plaintiff has obtained registrations in \nrespect of ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC PRO’ formative marks, the plaintiff \ncannot have exclusive rights to use the word ‘PRO’. Hence, at this \ninterlocutory stage, the plaintiff has failed to make out a case of \ninfringement. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 17 of 18 \n \n21. \nPlaintiff has also claimed that the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ has become \ndistinctive of its goods on account of its usage. Admittedly, the plaintiff has \nused the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ and other formative marks using the words \n‘CPVC’ and PRO’ only with effect from 2016. Nothing has been filed on \nbehalf of the plaintiff to show that the plaintiff has advertised or promoted \nthe mark ‘CPVC PRO’ on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, at an interlocutory \nstage, the plaintiff cannot claim acquired distinctiveness or goodwill in the \nterm ‘CPVC PRO’, which can only be established during the trial. Even \notherwise, as observed above, a comparison of the competing marks of the \nplaintiff and the defendant reveals that there is no likelihood of confusion in \nthe market. Hence, I am of the prima facie view that the defendant is not \npassing off its goods as those of the plaintiff. \n22. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has vehemently argued that the products in \nquestion, pipes, are used by plumbers, who identify the product with the \nterm ‘CPVC PRO’ and not the house marks. I do not find merit in this \nsubmission of the plaintiff. I see no reason as to why persons in the trade, \nincluding plumbers, would not identify with a product through the house \nmark which finds mention on the product. Nor has the plaintiff filed any \nmaterial to substantiate such a claim. \n23. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has placed strong reliance on the recent \njudgment of the Division Bench in PEPS Industries Private Limited v. \nKurlon Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine  Del 3275 to contend that (i) when the \ndefendant has sought for registration of the same mark as that of the plaintiff \n(‘NO TURN’ in the said case), such a defendant is estopped from raising a \nquestion on the validity of the said mark on the ground of it being \ndescriptive in nature; and, (ii) registration granted in favour of the plaintiff is \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\n2023/DHC/001281 \n \nCS(COMM) 309/2022                                                                                                 Page 18 of 18 \n \nprima facie evidence of its validity and cannot be ignored unless a question \non the validity of the registration is raised. \n24. \nIn the present case, the defendant has sought registration of the marks \nbearing the word ‘CPVC’ not on a stand-alone basis but along with its house \nmark ‘ASHIRVAD’. Therefore, it cannot be said that the defendant is \nestopped from raising the issue of non-distinctiveness of the term ‘CPVC \nPRO’ or its individual components.  Further, in the present case, the \ndefendant has raised objections with regard to validity of the registrations \ngranted in favour of the plaintiff.  Therefore, the judgment in PEPS \nIndustries (supra) is clearly distinguishable and would not advance the case \nof the plaintiff. \n25. \nIn light of the discussion above, I am of the view that the plaintiff has \nfailed to make out a prima facie case for grant of interim injunction. \n26. \nAccordingly, I.A.7334/2022 filed on behalf of the plaintiff under \nOrder XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC is dismissed. \n27. \nNeedless to state, any observations made herein are only for the \npurposes of adjudication of the present application and would have no \nbearing on the final outcome of the suit. \nCS(COMM) 309/2022, I.A. 8856/2022(O-XI R-1(4) of CPC), I.A. \n9750/2022 (O-XI R-1(10) of CC Act), I.A. 12468/2022(u/s 124 of Trade \nMark Act) and I.A. 19036/2022(O-XI R-1(4) of CPC) \n \n28. \nList for consideration on 24th April, 2023. \n \nAMIT BANSAL, J. \nFEBURARY 23, 2023/dk \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n"

The fact that conditions were imposed \non the plaintiff by the Registry, against the use of generic terms like ‘CPVC \nPRO’ and ‘CPVC CHEM PRO’, is clearly indicative of the fact that the \nplaintiff cannot monopolize the terms ‘CPVC’ or ‘PRO’, individually or in \nconjunction with each other. \n16. \nTo show that the word ‘PRO’ is generic and laudatory, the counsel for \nthe defendant has submitted dictionary meanings of the said word, which are \nas under: \n“Cambridge Dictionary: The word „PRO‟ means: \n \n(a) „a professional or somebody who is better than others at \ndoing something; \n \n(b) „a person who receives money for playing a sport‟; \n \nOxford Dictionary: The word PRO means: \n \n„a person who works as a professional, especially in a sport‟.” \n \n17. \nIn support of their submission that the word ‘PRO’ is commonly used \nin the trade, the defendant has also placed material on record to show that \nvarious companies are selling pipes and other products in the construction \nindustry using the word ‘PRO’. Counsel for the plaintiff has disputed this \nsubmission and stated that no other pipes with the word mark ‘PRO’ are \navailable in the market.

However, the court notes that the word \"SUPER\" has little distinctive character and cannot be used exclusively by the plaintiff. The court also observes that the defendant's use of \"Dabur\" as its house mark, alongside \"SUPER PANTS\", prevents any confusion.\n\nSource: 19. ASTRAL LTD Vs. ASHIRVAD PIPES PVT LTD (PDF)",

Ltd. v. Dabur India Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine \nDel  645. In the said case, the plaintiff sought an interim injunction against \nthe defendant on the ground that the trademark of the defendant ‘SUPER \nPANTS’ was deceptively similar to the trademark of the plaintiff ‘SUPER \nCUTES’ and ‘SUPER CUTESTERS’. Relying upon the judgment of a \nDivision Bench of this Court in Marico Limited v. Agro Tech Food \nLimited, 2010 (44) PTC 736 (Del) DB, the application for interim injunction \nwas dismissed. It was held, inter alia, that since the word ‘SUPER’ is being \nused in a laudatory manner, it is devoid of any distinctive character and \nincapable of distinguishing the goods of the plaintiff from that of others, and \ntherefore, even if the plaintiff had obtained registration in respect of the \nmark ‘SUPER’, it would not give the plaintiff exclusive right to use the \nmark ‘SUPER’. It was further noted that the fact that the house mark is \nwritten in a slightly smaller font would not make a material difference. One \nof the other grounds for denying injunction was that the defendant in the \nsaid case was using the mark ‘SUPER PANTS’ along with its house mark \n‘Dabur’. The relevant observations of the said judgment are set out below: \n“8. \nA comparison of the packaging of the defendant and the \nplaintiff above shows that other than the word “SUPER” \noccurring in both the aforesaid packaging, there is no other \nsimilarity. The packaging of the defendant includes the trade \nmark of the defendant, “Dabur” which is prominently \ndisplayed. Merely because the word “Dabur” is written in a \nslightly smaller font as compared to “SUPER PANTS”, in my \nopinion, would not make any difference.

As per the Oxford's Learners \nDictionary, the word “SUPER” means “extremely good”, and \nas per the Cambridge Dictionary also, the word “SUPER” \nmeans “excellent or extremely good”.

There is no quarrel to the proposition that \neven an ordinary word or a descriptive word, if acquires a \nsecondary meaning and has acquired a distinctive character, can \nbe protected by way of an injunction when identified with a \nparticular product or being from a particular source. As \ndiscussed above, DABUR's mark, i.e., “DABUR BABY SUPER \nPANTS” when taken as a whole cannot be termed as deceptively \nsimilar to SOOTHE's registered marks referred in „paragraph 2‟ \nabove. As far as the use of the word “SUPER” by DABUR in its \nmark, the same, prima facie seems to be laudatory and \ndescriptive of the product being offered by DABUR. \nIndisputably, the term “SUPER” is widely used in respect of \nvarious products not only of similar nature but also of different \nclass and categories. SOOTHE cannot, therefore, prima \nfacie claim that the use of the word “SUPER” by DABUR in its \nmark is deceptively similar to SOOTHE's registered trademark \nfor the reason that the word “SUPER” also appears in \nSOOTHE's marks referred in „paragraph 2‟ above. SOOTHE \nalso cannot prima facie claim that the word “SUPER” \nappearing in its registered mark has acquired a secondary \nmeaning or a distinctive character when used in a particular \nproduct of SOOTHE, i.e., diapers.” \n \n20. \nThe present case is covered on all fours by the aforesaid judgments. \nThe word ‘PRO’, of which exclusive use was sought by the plaintiff, is \nsimilar to the word ‘SUPER’ as both are laudatory words. Prima facie, the \nword ‘PRO’, either by itself or in conjunction with the word ‘CPVC’, \nappears to be non-distinctive and laudatory in terms of Section 9 of the \nTrade Marks Act, 1999. Even if the plaintiff has obtained registrations in \nrespect of ‘CPVC PRO’ and ‘CPVC PRO’ formative marks, the plaintiff \ncannot have exclusive rights to use the word ‘PRO’. Hence, at this \ninterlocutory stage, the plaintiff has failed to make out a case of \ninfringement. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified",

Admittedly, the plaintiff has \nused the mark ‘CPVC PRO’ and other formative marks using the words \n‘CPVC’ and PRO’ only with effect from 2016. Nothing has been filed on \nbehalf of the plaintiff to show that the plaintiff has advertised or promoted \nthe mark ‘CPVC PRO’ on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, at an interlocutory \nstage, the plaintiff cannot claim acquired distinctiveness or goodwill in the \nterm ‘CPVC PRO’, which can only be established during the trial. Even \notherwise, as observed above, a comparison of the competing marks of the \nplaintiff and the defendant reveals that there is no likelihood of confusion in \nthe market. Hence, I am of the prima facie view that the defendant is not \npassing off its goods as those of the plaintiff. \n22. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has vehemently argued that the products in \nquestion, pipes, are used by plumbers, who identify the product with the \nterm ‘CPVC PRO’ and not the house marks. I do not find merit in this \nsubmission of the plaintiff. I see no reason as to why persons in the trade, \nincluding plumbers, would not identify with a product through the house \nmark which finds mention on the product. Nor has the plaintiff filed any \nmaterial to substantiate such a claim. \n23. \nCounsel for the plaintiff has placed strong reliance on the recent \njudgment of the Division Bench in PEPS Industries Private Limited v. \nKurlon Limited, 2022 SCC OnLine  Del 3275 to contend that (i) when the \ndefendant has sought for registration of the same mark as that of the plaintiff \n(‘NO TURN’ in the said case), such a defendant is estopped from raising a \nquestion on the validity of the said mark on the ground of it being \ndescriptive in nature; and, (ii) registration granted in favour of the plaintiff is \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified",

Therefore, it cannot be said that the defendant is \nestopped from raising the issue of non-distinctiveness of the term ‘CPVC \nPRO’ or its individual components.  Further, in the present case, the \ndefendant has raised objections with regard to validity of the registrations \ngranted in favour of the plaintiff.  Therefore, the judgment in PEPS \nIndustries (supra) is clearly distinguishable and would not advance the case \nof the plaintiff. \n25. \nIn light of the discussion above, I am of the view that the plaintiff has \nfailed to make out a prima facie case for grant of interim injunction. \n26. \nAccordingly, I.A.7334/2022 filed on behalf of the plaintiff under \nOrder XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC is dismissed. \n27. \nNeedless to state, any observations made herein are only for the \npurposes of adjudication of the present application and would have no \nbearing on the final outcome of the suit. \nCS(COMM) 309/2022, I.A. 8856/2022(O-XI R-1(4) of CPC), I.A. \n9750/2022 (O-XI R-1(10) of CC Act), I.A. 12468/2022(u/s 124 of Trade \nMark Act) and I.A. 19036/2022(O-XI R-1(4) of CPC) \n \n28. \nList for consideration on 24th April, 2023. \n \nAMIT BANSAL, J. \nFEBURARY 23, 2023/dk \nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified",
