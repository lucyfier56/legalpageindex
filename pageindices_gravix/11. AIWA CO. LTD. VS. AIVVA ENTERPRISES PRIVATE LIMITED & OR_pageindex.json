    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary:**\n\n**Case Name:** AIWA Co. Ltd. vs AIVVA Enterprises Private Limited & Ors.\n\n**High Court Case No.:** 2023/DHC/000041\n**Court Name:** High Court of Delhi at New Delhi\n**Judgment Date:** January 5, 2023\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe case involves a dispute between AIWA Co. Ltd., the plaintiff, and AIVVA Enterprises Private Limited and others, the defendants. AIWA Co. Ltd. is a well-known Japanese company that manufactures audio equipment and holds several trademarks, including \"AIWA\". The defendant companies started using the name \"AIVVA\" in similar contexts, which led to a complaint from AIWA Co. Ltd.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\n\n1. **Trademark Infringement**: The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were infringing on their trademark rights by using the name \"AIVVA\", which is deceptively similar to \"AIWA\".\n2. **Passing Off**: The plaintiff claimed that the defendants were passing off their goods as those of AIWA Co. Ltd., causing confusion among consumers.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\nThe plaintiff argued that they had acquired significant reputation and goodwill for their brand, including trademark registrations in various classes. They also performed a search at the Trademark Registry, which revealed that there was no registration of the mark \"AIVVA\" or any similar name by the defendants. The plaintiff requested interim relief to restrain the defendants from using the infringing marks.\n\n**Court Findings:**\n\nThe Court held:\n\n1. **Likelihood of Confusion**: The Court found that the names \"AIWA\" and \"AIVVA\" were so similar that they could cause confusion among consumers.\n2. **Trademark Infringement**: The Court concluded that the defendants' use of the name \"AIVVA\" was an infringement on AIWA Co. Ltd.'s trademark rights.\n3. **Passing Off**: The Court found that the defendants' actions were likely to pass off their goods as those of AIWA Co. Ltd., causing consumer confusion.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe High Court of Delhi at New Delhi passed the following interim orders:\n\n1. **Ad Interim Injunction**: The Court granted an ad interim injunction restraining the defendants from using the marks \"AIVVA\" and \"AIVVA ENTERPRISES PRIVATE LIMITED\", as well as any other mark or name deceptively similar to AIWA Co. Ltd.'s trademarks.\n\n**Other Orders:**\n\n*     **Seizure of Goods**: The Court allowed the application for seizure of goods bearing the infringing marks in relation to the sale of a TV set.\n*     **Extension of Time**: The Court granted an extension of time for the respondents to file their reply to another interlocutory application.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe High Court of Delhi at New Delhi held that the defendants' actions constituted trademark infringement and passing off. The interim orders were passed to restrain the defendants from using the infringing marks until further orders.",

Notice in this application was issued on 10th October, 2022\nand reply thereto has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff.\nSUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANTS\n6.\nThe counsel for the defendants made the following submissions:\n6.1\nIt has wrongly been stated in the plaint that the plaintiff learnt of the\ndefendants’ use of the impugned marks in August, 2022 and have\napproached the Court without any delay. As is evident from the legal notice\ndated 17th August, 2020, the plaintiff was aware of the user of the mark\n‘AIVVA’ in August, 2020 by the defendants no.1 and 2, who were selling\nand marketing their products under the mark ‘AIVVA’ and the said products\nare also available for purchase on e-commerce platforms like IndiaMART.\n6.2\nThe plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the legal notice or its reply\nin the plaint.\n6.3\nA reading of the aforesaid legal notice shows that the plaintiff was\nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\n2023/DHC/000041\nCS(COMM) 606/2022\nPage 5 of 15\naware about the use of the ‘AIVVA’ trademark by Mr. Ajjaay Advani as\nwell as the registrations of the trademark ‘AIVVA’ in his favour in the year\n2015.\n6.4\nThe aforesaid legal notice was copied to a Hong Kong based entity,\nNu-World Global, which has been described in paragraph 2 of the aforesaid\nnotice as an entity to which rights to manufacture and sell products under the\n‘AIWA’ trademark have been assigned by the plaintiff. Further, the\naforesaid Nu-World Global assigned the rights in favour of Aiwa Consumer\nProducts LLP, a partnership firm in India on whose behalf the aforesaid\nlegal notice was sent. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim ignorance of the\naforesaid legal notice. This fact has also been stated in paragraph 5 (ii) of\nI.A. 16402/2022 and no specific denial thereto has been made on behalf of\nthe plaintiff.\n6.5\nIt has further been stated in the aforesaid legal notice that the\ndefendants no.1 and 2 are acting in connivance with Mr. Ajjaay Advani. The\naforesaid legal notice was duly replied to on behalf of Mr. Ajjaay Advani,\nwherein it was stated that the mark ‘AIVVA’ has been registered by him\nunder Classes 7, 9 and 11 as far back as in December, 2015. It was also\nstated in the reply that the domain name ‘www.aivva.com’ has been\nregistered by Mr. Ajjaay Advani in February, 2017.\n6.6\nThe plaintiff was aware of the registration of the mark ‘AIVVA’ in\nfavour of Mr. Ajjaay Advani but has failed to challenge the same. Despite\nalleging connivance between Mr. Ajjaay Advani and the defendants, Mr.\nAjjaay Advani has not been made a party in the suit.\n6.7\nIn the affidavit filed on behalf of Mr. Ajjaay Advani filed along with\nthe written statement, it has been stated that Mr. Ajjaay Advani has given\nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n2023/DHC/000041\nCS(COMM) 606/2022\nPage 6 of 15\npermission to the defendants no.1 and 2 to use the trademark ‘AIVVA’.\n6.8\nNo written authorization was required to be given by a registered\nproprietor of a trademark for use of the aforesaid trademark. Reliance in this\nregard is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cycle\nCorporation of India Ltd. v. T.I. Raleigh Industries Pvt. Ltd. and Ors.,\n(1996) 9 SCC 430.\n6.9\nIt has wrongly been stated in the plaint that the defendants have been\nselling TVs under the mark ‘AIWA’ as the defendants have only been\nselling TVs under the mark ‘AIVVA’. Reliance has been placed on the\nvarious invoices of the defendants from May, 2016 in this regard.\n6.10\nNo documents have been filed on behalf of the plaintiff showing user\nof the trademark ‘AIWA’ prior to the user of the defendants. On the other\nhand, defendants have filed invoices to show their user of the trademark\n‘AIVVA’ since 2016.\n7.\nCounsel for the defendants has also placed reliance on the judgments\nin Micolube India Ltd. v. Maggon Auto Centre &Anr., 2008 (36) PTC 231\n(Del.), Thukral Mechanical Works v. Nitin Machine Tools P. Ltd. &Anr.,\n(1998) 18 PTC 767, Standipack Private Limited &Ors. v. Oswal Trading\nCo. Ltd. &Ors., 1999 PTC (19) 479, B.L. and Co. and others v. Pfizer\nProducts Incl., (2001) 93 DLT 346 (DB) and Kent Ro System Ltd. v.\nGattubhai, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 791.\nSUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF\n8.\nPer contra, counsel for the plaintiff made the following submissions:\n8.1\nThe plaintiff duly conducted a search of the Trademark Registry\nbefore filing the present suit and has filed the search report along with the\nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nCS(COMM) 606/202\nplaint, in terms o\nAjjaay Advani.\n8.2\nThe defen\nor any other wr\nThere is nothin\nAdvani.\n8.3\nThe very\nthe CPC is bas\nAugust, 2020 w\n8.4\nThe afore\nplaintiff, nor did\nbeing sent to Mr\n8.5\nThe prese\nas it is the said\ntrademark of the\n8.6\nThe use\nand\ncorporate name,\nbut also an attem\nwell-known trad\n8.7\nIt is wron\nplaintiff’s tradem\nthe additional d\ndefendants are\n‘www.indiamart\n2023/DHC/000041\n22\nof which the mark ‘AIVVA’ is register\nndant companies have failed to show th\nritten authorization in their favour from\nng to suggest that the defendants are\npremise of the application under Ord\ned on a wrong assumption that the l\nas sent on behalf of the plaintiff.\nesaid notice was neither sent by the pla\nd the plaintiff have any knowledge abo\nr.

The\ndefendants have failed to place on record any written agreement between\nthem and Mr. Ajjaay Advani permitting the use of the trademark ‘AIWA’ by\nthe defendants with effect from 2015.\n8.11\nReliance placed on the judgment in Raleigh Industries (supra) is\nmisplaced as the aforesaid judgment was under the Trade and Merchandise\nMarks Act, 1958 (old Act). In any case, the defendants have failed to show\nan unbroken trade connection between the defendants and Mr. Ajjaay\nAdvani and therefore, the judgment in Raleigh Industries (supra) is not\napplicable.\n8.12\nThe defendants in their brochure have wrongly claimed registration of\nthe mark ‘AIVVA’, when in fact, they were not the registered proprietors of\nthe aforesaid trademark. In any event, the defendants were not authorized to\nuse the stylized imitation of the plaintiff’s trademark as there was no\nregistration in respect of such stylized version.\nANALYSIS & FINDINGS\n9.\nI shall now proceed to deal with the rival contentions raised by the\ncounsels appearing on behalf of the parties.\nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 9 ---\n2023/DHC/000041\nCS(COMM) 606/2022\nPage 9 of 15\n10.\nSince the case of the defendants is primarily premised on the legal\nnotice dated 17th August, 2020, I propose to deal with the same first.\n11.\nThe aforesaid legal notice has been sent on behalf of one Aiwa\nConsumer Products LLP, a partnership firm having its corporate office at A-\n62, Naraina Industrial Area, Phase-I, New Delhi-110028. There is nothing\non record to suggest any connection of the aforesaid entity with the plaintiff\ncompany or the fact that the plaintiff company was aware of sending of the\naforesaid legal notice.\n12.\nCounsel for the defendants has vehemently submitted that the term\n‘my client’ in the aforesaid notice would include the principals of the entity\nsending the notice. However, nothing has been placed on record to show that\nthe plaintiff company is the principal of the aforesaid entity. Merely because\nthe entity sending the legal notice uses the name ‘AIWA’ or that the plaintiff\ncompany has not initiated any legal action against the aforesaid entity for\nhaving sent the legal notice using the name of the plaintiff company, it\ncannot be contended that the aforesaid notice was sent with the knowledge\nand consent of the plaintiff company. It was for the defendants to show that\nthere was a connection between the said entity and the plaintiff company or\nthat the plaintiff company was aware of the aforesaid legal notice.\n13.\nOnce again, the fact that the aforesaid legal notice is copied to Nu-\nWorld Global, who is stated to be an assignee of the plaintiff company,\nwould not be sufficient to attribute knowledge of the aforesaid legal notice\nto the plaintiff company. To make good the allegations of suppression and\nconcealment, the defendants would have to show that it was within the\nknowledge of the plaintiff company that the aforesaid legal notice was sent\non their behalf. This has not been done in the present case and therefore, I do\nDigitally Signed\nBy:AMIT BANSAL\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\n2023/DHC/000041\nCS(COMM) 606/2022\nPage 10 of 15\nnot find merit in the submission of the defendants that the plaintiff was\naware of the legal notice or that they had deliberately suppressed the\naforesaid legal notice in order to obtain an ex parte ad interim injunction\nagainst the defendants.\n14.\nIn view of the above, there is no reason to disbelieve the submission\nmade in the plaint that the plaintiff company became aware of the\ndefendants no.1 and 2 infringing its trademark only in August, 2022, upon\ncoming across the brochure of the defendants and soon thereafter, the\npresent suit was filed. In other words, there is no basis to contend that the\ninterim order passed by this Court on 2nd September, 2022 was passed on the\naccount of concealment and suppression on behalf of the plaintiff or that\nthere was any delay on behalf of the plaintiff in filing the present suit. In\nview thereof, the judgments relied upon by the defendants in respect of\nconcealment i.e., Micolube India Ltd. (supra), Thukral Mechanical Works\n(supra), Standipack Private Limited (supra) and Kent Ro System Ltd.\n(supra) would not have any application to the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case. Further, the judgment in B.L. and Co.
