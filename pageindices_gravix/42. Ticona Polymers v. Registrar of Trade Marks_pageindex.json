    "decision_summary": "**Case Summary: Ticona Polymers Inc. v. Registrar of Trade Marks**\n\n**Background:**\nTicona Polymers Inc., a company, filed an application (No. 2847019) to register the word mark \"COOLPOLY\" as a trade mark in two classes: Class 1 for plastic and carbon moulding materials for use in the manufacture of moulded plastic articles, and Class 9 for moulded heat sinks for use in computers and parts and components thereof and moulded electrical conductors. The application was filed on November 19, 2014.\n\n**Legal Issues:**\nThe issue in this case is whether the word mark \"COOLPOLY\" meets the requirements for registration as a trade mark under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Specifically, the company's application was objected to by the Registrar of Trade Marks on the grounds that:\n\n1. The mark is devoid of distinctive character (Section 9(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act).\n2. The mark is similar or identical to an earlier trade mark and/or services (Section 11 of the Trade Marks Act).\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n* Ticona Polymers Inc. argued that the word mark \"COOLPOLY\" is distinctive and has been registered in various jurisdictions.\n* They also contended that the Senior Examiner's objections under Section 11 were wrong, as the cited marks are visually, phonetically, and conceptually different.\n\n**Court Findings:**\nThe Hon'ble Mr. Justice C.Hari Shankar of the High Court of Delhi examined the arguments made by both sides and considered the relevant provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. He found that:\n\n* The word mark \"COOLPOLY\" is a combination of two English words, \"cool\" and \"poly\".\n* As a whole, the mark \"COOLPOLY\" is not inherently distinctive; rather, it is descriptive of the goods for which registration was sought.\n* Since the application is filed on a \"proposed to be used\" basis, the mark has not acquired any secondary meaning.\n\n**Decision:**\nBased on these findings, the court upheld the impugned order passed by the Senior Examiner in rejecting Ticona Polymers Inc.'s trade mark application. The decision was made under Section 91 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\n\nThis is to note, however, that this summary is limited and certain points from the given text are not explicitly elaborated up on and few crucial information are not discussed at length.",

JUSTICE C.HARI SHANKAR \n \n \n \n \nJUDGMENT (ORAL) \n% \n \n \n \n         28.02.2023 \n \n1. \nThis appeal, under Section 91 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, \nassails order dated 26th October 2020 passed by the Senior Examiner \nin the office of the Registrar of Trade Marks, whereby Application \nNo. 2847019, filed by the appellant for registration of the word mark \n―COOLPOLY‖, in (i) Class 1 in respect of plastic and carbon \nmoulding materials for use in the manufacture of moulded plastic \narticles and (ii) Class 9 in respect of moulded heat sinks for use in \ncomputers and parts and components thereof and moulded electrical \nconductors, was rejected. \n \n2. \nApplication No. 2847019 was filed by the appellant on 19th \nNovember 2014.  Consequent to a preliminary scrutiny, First \nExamination Report (FER) dated 13th January 2016 was issued by the \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 2 of 8 \n \n \nRegistrar, objecting to the registration of the aforesaid mark \nCOOLPOLY under Sections 9(1)(a)1 and 11(1) (though not expressly \nquoted) of the Trade Marks Act.  The objections in the FER read thus: \n \n―1.  The trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive \ncharacter, that is to say, not capable of distinguishing the goods \nor services of one person from those of another person; \n \n2.  \nThe Trade Mark application is open to objection on \nrelative grounds of refusal under Section 11 of the Act because \nthe same/similar trade mark(s) is/are already on record of the \nregister for the same or similar goods/services.  The detail of \nsame/similar trade marks is enclosed herewith  \n \nSave as provided in Sec. 12, a trade mark shall not be \nregistered if, because of-its identity with an earlier trade mark \nand similarity of goods or services covered by; the trade mark; \nor its similarity to an earlier trade mark and the identity or \nsimilarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark,‖ \n \n3. \n Additionally, the FER required the appellant to file the duly \nstamped TM-48 which, Ms. Aamna Hasan submits, was filed. \n \n4. \nOf the aforesaid two objections raised in the FER, the impugned \norder has dropped the objections predicated on Sections 11 and 12.  \nThe Senior Examiner proceeds, thereafter, to reject the appellant’s \napplication on the ground that  \n(i) \nCOOLPOLY was merely a combination of the two \nEnglish words COOL and POLY, \n(ii) \nCOOLPOLY, as a whole, was not inherently distinctive,  \n(iii) the mark was, on the other hand, descriptive of the goods \nin respect of which its registration was sought, and \n                                          \n1 9.  \nAbsolute grounds for refusal of registration. –   \n(1)  \nThe trade marks –  \n(a)  \nwhich are devoid of any distinctive character, that is to say, not capable of \ndistinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of another person; \n***** \n \nshall not be registered. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 3 of 8 \n \n \n(iv) \nas registration was sought on a ―proposed to be used‖ \nbasis, it had not acquired any secondary meaning. \n(It is not clear from the impugned order, which is extremely clumsily \nwritten and worded, whether the Senior Examiner finds COOLPOLY \nas a whole to be descriptive or whether she finds COOL and POLY \nindividually to be descriptive.)  \n  \n5. \nThe following passage from the impugned order contains what \nmay be called the reasoning of the Senior Examiner: \n \n―Adv. Aamna Hasan appeared and argued and submitted that. \nGoods have no reference to mark, and the mark is registered in \nvarious jurisdictions so consider as a distinctive. Thirdly sec. 11 \nis not applicable, heard, and checked the details of application, it \nappears that, total five opportunities of hearing given. As per \ndetails on record and submission made by advocate it appears \nthat, the cited marks are visually ,phonetically, and conceptually \ndifferent, so obj. u/s 11 waived, moreover obj. u/s 9 is sustain \nbecause mark as a whole is not inherently distinctive, it is a \nmere combination of an English word \"coolpoly\" which is not \ndistinctive and descriptive to applied goods of \"[CLASS-1] \nPlastic and carbon molding materials for use in the manufacture \nof molded plastic articles.[CLASS-9] Molded heat sinks for use \nin computers and parts and components therefore and molded \nelectrical conductors.\" .the mark is mere combination of word \n\"cool\" and \"poly\" hence it is not inherently distinctive, so no one \ncan claim any exclusive right over the descriptive word, until \nand unless the mark has acquired distinctiveness by long and \ncontinuous commercial use and Mark is descriptive in nature \nand has direct reference to goods applied, it has describes \nquality and intended purpose, further more it is a proposed to be \nused mark, so not having user so no acquired secondary \nmeaning. The adv. Also submitted that, the mark is registered in \nvarious jurisdiction so consider as distinctive, whereas trans-\nborder reputation or goodwill is not recognized by the Hon. \nSupreme court in landmark judgment of PRIUS. Furthermore, it \nis a well settled law that, mere combination of two known word \nor abbreviation thereof would not be an invented word, even \nthough the combination may not have been in use before, if to \nthe eyes or ear the same idea would be conveyed as by the \nwords in its ordinary form, as decided in the cases of \"E. \n                                                                                                                   \nProvided that a trade mark shall not be refused registration if before the date of \napplication for registration it has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or \nis a well-known trade mark. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 4 of 8 \n \n \nGriffiths Hughes Ltd. vs Vick Chemical Co.

As \nsuch, the Senior Examiner holds that the mark was not inherently \ndistinctive as required by Section 9(1)(a) of the Trademarks Act. \n \n11. \n It is well settled that a mark cannot be dissected into its \nindividual parts while examining its entitlement to registration.  \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 5 of 8 \n \n \nThough Section 17(1)2 of the Trademarks Act statutory embodies this \nanti-dissection principle in the context of infringement proceedings, \nthe principle would apply, mutatis mutandis, even at the stage when \nthe mark is examined for its entitlement for registration as it is only \nthe factum of registration which brings, in its wake, the privileges that \nfollow, including protection against infringement.  \n \n12. \nSeen as a whole, it cannot be said that the word COOLPOLY \nhas any etymological meaning or significance in the English language.  \nIt is not a word of common – or, for that manner, even uncommon – \nusage, as would render it incapable of distinguishing goods of one \nperson from those of another if used as a trade mark.  Indeed, the \nimpugned order is silent as to why the mark is not distinctive.  Rather, \nthe Senior Examiner appears to have, clearly erroneously, conflated \nthe concept of lack of distinctiveness, addressed by Section 9(1)(a), \nand descriptiveness, addressed by Section 9(1)(b), and confused the \ntwo.   \n \n13. \nSection 9(1)(a) would apply only where a mark was so common \nand so lacking in distinction as would make it impossible, on the basis \nof that mark, to distinguish between the goods of one person and \ngoods of another. Common English words and phrases of everyday \nusage would fall within this category.  Such common English words \ncannot be registered as marks, unless they enjoy the benefit of the \n                                          \n2 17.  \nEffect of registration of parts of a mark. –  \n(1)  \nWhen a trade mark consists of several matters, its registration shall confer on the \nproprietor exclusive right to the use of the trade mark taken as a whole. \n(2)  \nNotwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), when a trade mark— \n(a)  \ncontains any part –  \n(i)  \nwhich is not the subject of a separate application by the proprietor for \nregistration as a trade mark; or \n(ii)  \nwhich is not separately registered by the proprietor as a trade mark; or \n(b)  \ncontains any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of a non-\ndistinctive character, \nthe registration thereof shall not confer any exclusive right in the matter forming only a part of the \nwhole of the trade mark so registered. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 6 of 8 \n \n \nproviso to Section 9(1), which would apply where the mark, before the \ndate of registration, has acquired distinctiveness –in trade mark \nterminology, a ―secondary meaning‖ –  by dint of long or continuous \nuse, or is a ―well known trade mark‖ within the meaning of Section \n2(1)(zg)3 of the Trade Marks Act.    \n \n14. \nThe impugned order does not hold that COOLPOLY is a word \nof common English usage.  Indeed, as already noted, COOLPOLY has \nno meaning.  The impugned order does not cite any other mark of any \nother person, similar to ―COOLPOLY‖ or provide any reason as to \nwhy the use of the mark ―COOLPOLY‖ in respect of goods for which \nregistration was sought by the appellant would make it impossible to \ndistinguish between the said goods or any other goods available in the \nmarket. \n \n15. \nAdverting, next, to the aspect of descriptiveness, COOLPOLY, \nbeing a word with no meaning, can obviously not be regarded as \ndescriptive of the goods in respect of which registration was sought by \nthe appellant.  For that matter, it cannot be said that either of the parts \nof the mark ―COOL‖ or ―POLY‖, even seen individually, is \ndescriptive of the nature of the goods in respect of which registration \nwas sought.  Registration of the mark ―COOLPOLY‖ was sought in \nrespect of plastic and carbon moulding materials used in the \nmanufacture of moulded plastic articles and moulded heat sinks for \nuse in computers and parts and components thereof and moulded \nelectrical conductors.  The impugned order is silent as to how the \nwords ―COOL‖ and ―POLY‖ even if seen individually, are descriptive \n                                          \n3 (zg)  \n―well-known trade mark‖, in relation to any goods or services, means a mark which has become so \nto the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or receives such services that the use of such \nmark in relation to other goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection in the course \nof trade or rendering of services between those goods or services and a person during the mark in relation to \nthe first-mentioned goods or services. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 7 of 8 \n \n \nof the products in respect of which registration was sought or were \nwanting any distinctive character. \n \n16. \nThe basic prerequisites of Section 9(1)(a) do not appear to be \naddressed in the impugned order.  In a sense, the impugned order is \nunreasoned, as it merely holds, as the mere ipse dixit of the Senior \nExaminer, that the expression ―COOL‖ and ―POLY‖ were descriptive \nof the products in respect of which registration was sought.   \n \n17. \nThis Court is not inclined to agree with the said reasoning or \nconclusion.  In the opinion of the Court, \n(i) \nCOOLPOLY cannot, for examining distinctiveness, be \nvivisected into COOL and POLY, \n(ii) \nCOOLPOLY is not a word of common English usage, \n(iii) COOLPOLY, if used as a mark by one person is, \ntherefore, perfectly capable of distinguishing the goods or \nservices of that person, in respect of which the mark is used, \nfrom the goods and services of others, \n(iv) \nthe proscription against registration contained in Section \n9(1)(a) would not, therefore, apply, \n(v) \nneither COOLPOLY, nor COOL and POLY individually \nseen, are descriptive of the goods in respect of which the \nappellant sought registration of the COOLPOLY mark and \n(vi) \nthe proscription against registration contained in Section \n9(1)(b) would also, therefore, not apply. \n \n18. \nAs such, the impugned order, which is unsustainable in law or \non facts, is quashed and set aside.   \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nNeutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/001489 \nC.A.(COMM.IPD-TM) 89/2022  \nPage 8 of 8 \n \n \n19. \nAs the application of the appellant has yet to be advertised, the \napplication is remanded to the Registrar to advertise the mark and \nproceed thereafter in accordance with the provisions of the \nTrademarks Act and the Trademarks Rule.   \n \n20. \nThe appeal stands allowed accordingly with no orders as to \ncosts. \n \n21. \nMs. Hasan prays that a direction for a time bound decision may \nbe passed.  This Court is hesitant to do so as this Court is not aware of \nthe amount of work which is pending before the Registrar.

The adv. Also submitted that, the mark is registered in \nvarious jurisdiction so consider as distinctive, whereas trans-\nborder reputation or goodwill is not recognized by the Hon. \nSupreme court in landmark judgment of PRIUS. Furthermore, it \nis a well settled law that, mere combination of two known word \nor abbreviation thereof would not be an invented word, even \nthough the combination may not have been in use before, if to \nthe eyes or ear the same idea would be conveyed as by the \nwords in its ordinary form, as decided in the cases of \"E. \n                                                                                                                   \nProvided that a trade mark shall not be refused registration if before the date of \napplication for registration it has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or \nis a well-known trade mark. \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified",

In a sense, the impugned order is \nunreasoned, as it merely holds, as the mere ipse dixit of the Senior \nExaminer, that the expression ―COOL‖ and ―POLY‖ were descriptive \nof the products in respect of which registration was sought.   \n \n17. \nThis Court is not inclined to agree with the said reasoning or \nconclusion.  In the opinion of the Court, \n(i) \nCOOLPOLY cannot, for examining distinctiveness, be \nvivisected into COOL and POLY, \n(ii) \nCOOLPOLY is not a word of common English usage, \n(iii) COOLPOLY, if used as a mark by one person is, \ntherefore, perfectly capable of distinguishing the goods or \nservices of that person, in respect of which the mark is used, \nfrom the goods and services of others, \n(iv) \nthe proscription against registration contained in Section \n9(1)(a) would not, therefore, apply, \n(v) \nneither COOLPOLY, nor COOL and POLY individually \nseen, are descriptive of the goods in respect of which the \nappellant sought registration of the COOLPOLY mark and \n(vi) \nthe proscription against registration contained in Section \n9(1)(b) would also, therefore, not apply. \n \n18. \nAs such, the impugned order, which is unsustainable in law or \non facts, is quashed and set aside.   \n \nDigitally Signed\nBy:SUNIL SINGH NEGI\nSigning Date:01.03.2023\n16:56:15\nSignature Not Verified",
